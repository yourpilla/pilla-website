 - Responsible Persons should identify and plan the selection of suitable, competent contractors by arranging work with industry-known contractors, contractors recommended by manufacturers, or entering into an agreement with the manufacturer for service and maintenance of equipment.
- Safety inspections of services and fire safety systems or venue refurbishment, where the use of industry-known contractors is not reasonably practicable, should be arranged with recommended local contractors. These contractors should be asked for copies of their insurance (public &amp; employers liability), risk assessments, and method statements for the work planned, and details of any trade association or professional body membership they are associated with (which proves their competence has been measured).
- Ensure work is planned outside of normal opening times to reduce risk to clientele and manage the duties of employees so the work of contractors does not impact their safety.
- Plan works so the contractors are greeted by a senior manager, escorted to the area where they will be working, and ensure works are supervised by a member of staff while contractors are on site.
- Ensure the employee supervising works has a good knowledge of the venue and the business and has contact with a Responsible Person in the event of a query from a contractor that may affect the business.
- Ensure the health and safety documentation submitted by the contractor is kept on file in the event there is an incident, a fault occurs, or it is identified that work completed is not up to the required standard.
- Review and monitor your company's management of contractors to ensure these safety arrangements remain suitable and sufficient to reduce risk at your venue.
