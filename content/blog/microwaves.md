Food poisoning frequently occurs when microwave ovens have been used to cook food. This is quite often due to the user not understanding the science behind how microwaves work or failing to follow the procedures specific to the use of microwaves.

 At a microscopic level, microwave energy causes water molecules in food to vibrate at thousands of times per second creating heat. This heat then radiates through the food. &nbsp;Unfortunately, due to the nature and texture of different types of foods, they differ in density in different parts of the food and therefore do not cook evenly through the product.

 Normally, foods cooked in microwave ovens need turning, rotating and stirring in order that all parts are adequately cooked, it is also important that a certain amount of standing time is also observed to allow heat to radiate through foods to cook them to safe temperatures.

 It is very important that when probing microwaved foods that the tip of the probe reaches the parts of the food that are the most unlikely to have cooked properly i.e. The densest or thickest part of the food.

 ## Type

 Commercial grade microwave ovens must be used only, they are designed for prolonged and continuous use, they are built more sturdily, they are easier to clean and break down less frequently.
