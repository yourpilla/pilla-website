## Essential storage conditions

 Prior to display ensure that all food to be used are kept under the appropriate storage conditions until immediately before service i.e. Chilled, frozen or hot storage.

 This reduces time that the food will be at ambient temperature.

 ## Time and temperature

 Chilled foods that are to be put on display must ideally be held at 5Â°c immediately leading up to display.
