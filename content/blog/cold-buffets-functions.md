 Poor handling and storage practices of food used for functions and buffets can lead to food borne illness so temperature control and protection from contamination is essential to food safety. Staff must follow the safety points in order to achieve a consistent level of food safety.

 ## Essential storage conditions

 Prior to display ensure that all food to be used are kept under the appropriate storage conditions until immediately before service i.e. Chilled, frozen or hot storage.

 This reduces time that the food will be at ambient temperature.

 ## Time and temperature

 Chilled foods that are to be put on display must ideally be held at 5°c immediately leading up to display.

 Chilled items on ambient display for over four hours must be discarded, these same items must be covered or protected from contamination throughout that time. E.g. flies, dust, people sneezing etc.

 Hot foods on ambient display e.g. Buffet must be discarded after two hours, these same items must be protected from contamination through that time.

 Foods can be held under chilled storage using cold display units which will maintain the normal storage conditions of a fridge, this is the best option whenever possible.

 Cooked foods can also be held under hot holding conditions (above 63°c) in suitable equipment, normal hot holding protocols will apply.

 ## Preparation

 It is essential that in order to avoid potential hazards from bacterial multiplication and spore or toxin formation that foods are not prepared too far in advance.

 Ideally prepare food for an evening event in the afternoon and food for an afternoon event in the morning as close to the event as possible.

 Preparation of food too far in advance is one of the most common causes of food borne illness.

 ## Covering foods

 Always ensure that food on display is protected from outside contaminants, buffet foods left out at ambient storage temperatures must have some form of appropriate covering.

 Chilled display units should have sneeze guards fitted.

 ## Protection

 Keep doors and windows closed during functions and buffets to avoid problems with flying insects, dust and other contaminants.

 Alternatively ensure that windows and doors are proofed against pest ingress by the use of fly screening and fitting door closers.

 ## Company disclaimer

 Under the following conditions the customer should sign the company disclaimer:

 - Customers wishing to bring in their own food for a function.
- Customers wishing to appoint an outside caterer for the provision of food brought onto the premises.
- &nbsp;Customers wishing to remove “leftovers” from the premises for consumption off site.

 Customers must sign and date the disclaimer document.&nbsp;

 Your company should not accept any responsibility regarding any food provided by others or for food produced on site which has been taken off site, where they hold no control for the safety of that product.

 ## Corrective actions if things go wrong

 - Re-organise storage space or arrange for extra or alternative storage facilities.
- Reject foods that are not of good quality or if you suspect that safety has been compromised.
- Change your methods or set up of the kitchen to ensure that separate areas are used.
- Use alternative methods of display if cross contamination is an issue.
- Foods that have been cross contaminated must be discarded.
- Discard chilled foods held at ambient temperatures after a period of no more than four hours and discard hot food held at ambient temperatures after a period of no longer than two hours.
- If safety points are not followed, then retrain staff and increase supervision until competency can be shown.
