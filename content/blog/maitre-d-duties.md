 ## Step 1: Start with Venue Atmosphere and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 Including a brief overview of your establishment at the top of the job description is crucial. This section should give prospective head waiters a clear idea of what type of environment they will be joining. This introduction is also beneficial when writing a job description for a current employee, serving as a reminder of the key elements of your venue’s ethos.

 **Your goal is to help the candidate quickly understand:**

- The style and theme of the restaurant

- The nature of service provided

- The workplace culture and what makes it unique

 Follow this straightforward structure to begin:

 **1. What type of restaurant are you?**

 Begin with a descriptor: “We’re a fine dining restaurant / a bustling café / a family-run bistro / a themed dining venue…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Explain the speed and manner of service. For instance:

- “We pride ourselves on prompt, courteous service with an emphasis on attention to detail.”

- “We offer a leisurely dining experience with full table service and an extensive menu.”

- “Our venue combines traditional service with an interactive guest experience.”

 **3. What makes your place unique or enjoyable to work at?**

 This may include your team’s spirit, the restaurant’s layout, or its value system. Consider:

- “We work as a close-knit group, with everyone supporting one another.”

- “Our menu features local products, updated seasonally.”

- “Staff participate in monthly wine tasting and service improvement workshops.”

- “We are committed to being eco-friendly and sustainably responsible.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Consider what a day in your restaurant typically looks like.

- Reflect on how many covers you serve a night.

- Decide whether customers primarily book, walk-in, or experience a blend of service styles.

- Think about the team's dynamics — quick and methodical, or relaxed and conversational?

- Consider what staff frequently praise about the workplace.

 **Example 1: High-energy restaurant**

 We’re a vibrant city centre restaurant, offering an exciting array of dishes to a dynamic clientele. Our team operates swiftly, maintaining exceptional service standards throughout. We put our heart into creating dishes with locally-sourced ingredients.

 **Example 2: Relaxed fine dining venue**

 Our restaurant offers an intimate fine dining experience, placing emphasis on thorough service and menu knowledge. The team ensures a warm welcome and in-depth engagement with guests, enhancing each dining experience.

 ## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Head Waiter

 A vague job description can deter potential talent from applying, due to uncertainty over the actual task requirements. Thus, it is essential to clearly outline the primary responsibilities expected of the head waiter at your establishment.

 **Your goal is to create a list that accurately represents what the head waiter in your restaurant will do daily, rather than borrowing from a generic template.**

 Develop 6–10 bullet points illustrating the primary tasks, segmented into pre-service, active service, and post-service duties.

 **1. Pre-service responsibilities**

 These are tasks handled prior to the service shift.

 Consider:

- How is the station prepared before service?

- What needs to be checked or organised?

 Common examples:

- Ensure tables are set up correctly with all necessary cutlery and glassware.

- Coordinate with the kitchen to confirm the menu and any specials for the day.

- Brief staff on service expectations, timetable, and reservations.

 **2. Active service responsibilities**

 These cover duties during service times.

 Consider:

- Does the head waiter interact directly with guests?

- Are they involved in assisting with special requests or issues?

 Common examples:

- Lead the front-of-house team to ensure smooth and efficient service.

- Address guest inquiries about the menu or wine selection.

- Supervise the pace of service to maintain a pleasant dining experience.

- Oversee the transition between courses, ensuring tables are cleared and reset promptly.

 **3. Post-service responsibilities**

 These involve the tasks to be completed post-shift.

 Consider:

- Who assesses the dining area at closing?

- What needs cleaning or organising at the day's end?

 Common examples:

- Ensure the dining area and stations are cleaned and organised for the next shift.

- Coordinate with kitchen staff for a debrief on the service conclusions.

- Update and report wine inventory and recommend orders to management.

- Review guest feedback cards or reviews left during service.

 **If you already have Head Waiters but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe Their Work Habits: For insight into how they manage floor operations, team coordination, and customer relations during service.

- Request Their Input: Ask for a summarised list of their daily tasks which might not be apparent.

- Consult Supervisors: Discuss with your restaurant manager or maitre d' to gain comprehensive insights.

 Consider asking your Head Waiters the following:

- What are your essential duties before, during, and after service?

- How do you manage guest satisfaction and resolve any issues?

- How do you support and coach junior waitstaff?

- What steps do you take to ensure all service runs consistently?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Have an experienced staff member walk you through a typical shift.

- Refer to your checklists or service guidelines for ideas.

- Reflect on what goes amiss when this role isn’t fulfilled effectively — this helps to clarify crucial responsibilities.

 **Example for a mid-sized bistro**

 As a head waiter, you will:

- Oversee service preparation with attention to detail in table settings and allocations.

- Facilitate a smooth service by managing junior staff and assisting as needed.

- Communicate any changes or specials effectively to your team and guests.

- Gather and relay guest feedback constructively to improve service.

- Supervise the dining area post-service to ensure it’s ready for the next day.

 ## Step 3: Define the Required Skills

 After establishing the responsibilities, it’s time to list the skills necessary for a head waiter to excel in your restaurant. This section should filter suitable applicants and ensure you attract candidates who match your needs.

 **Your goal is to compile a list of must-have and beneficial skills based on your outlet’s operational style and standards — exclusively tailored to your requirements.**

 **1. Review your responsibilities**

 With each task, ask:

 “What skill is essential to perform this efficiently?”

 Example:

- If they manage wine service → they require wine pairing and up-selling skills

- If they oversee other staff → they need leadership and team management skills

- If they handle guest issues → they need problem-solving and diplomatic communication skills

 **2. Divide the skills into two lists**

- Essential skills:

 These are non-negotiable; candidates must have these skills when they start.

- Preferred skills:

 These are an advantage but not compulsory; opportunities for development exist.

 **Common skill areas to consider**

- Knowledge of food and wine pairing

- Advanced customer service and conflict resolution

- Supervisory and staff management

- Outstanding communication and presentation

- High efficiency in multi-tasking during busy service

- Familiarity with POS systems and reservation management

- Strong attention to detail

 **Example for an upscale dining establishment**

 Essential Skills

- Strong familiarity with formal dining etiquette and service pace

- Experience in wine service, including an ability to suggest pairings

- Proven supervisory skills with the capability to manage staff

- Ability to provide polished, professional service at all times

 **Preferred Skills**

- Experience with international cuisine and wine pairings

- Familiarity with reservation systems like OpenTable or Resy

- Knowledge of dietary restrictions and creative menu offerings

 **Example for a casual dining restaurant**

 Essential Skills

- Proven record of effective customer service and satisfaction

- Ability to coordinate service efficiently in high-traffic settings

- Proficiency in using and managing POS systems

- Ability to maintain cleanliness and attention to detail

 **Preferred Skills**

- Background in leading hospitality training sessions for new staff

- Experience in managing stock and supplies efficiently

- An interest in culinary trends or local gastronomy

 ## Step 4: Determining Required Experience

 Clearly define the extent of experience the candidate should possess. This assists in setting realistic expectations for the role and prevents time spent on under-qualified applicants.

 **Your goal is to specify the expected type of experience and the level of understanding a candidate should have, rather than simply a time-based measure.**

 **1. Categorise the role as entry, mid, or senior level**

- Entry-level: Willing to train candidates with minimal experience

- Mid-level: Requires substantial experience in a comparable role, with performance proven skills

- Senior: Must come with extensive prior experience handling similar responsibilities and leading teams

 Avoid misleading by labelling a role as senior if it doesn't demand leadership — this can create exploitative conditions.

 **2. Focus on the type of working experience**

 Instead of saying “3 years’ experience required,” specify:

- Do they need experience in a fast-paced, high-demand environment?

- Have they worked within a similar dining format or customer service approach?

 Ensure clarity, as working in a coffee shop differs significantly from a role in a five-star hotel restaurant.

 **3. Clarify training opportunities**

 Indicate clearly if the position will provide training or if you require an independent starter with existing competencies.

 **Example for an intermediate candidate**

 "We seek someone with a minimum of one year of direct supervisor experience in a restaurant. You should be adept in staff oversight, demonstrating solid guest management skills. Training support will be available, yet you’ll need to be immediately effective on the floor."

 **Example for a mentoring environment**

 "Formal experience isn’t essential, but a passion for hospitality and customer service is. We provide comprehensive training modules to develop your skills in leadership and dining service."

 **Example for a senior role**

 "Candidates must have a minimum of two years managing a team within a reputable dining establishment. Experience in maintaining high-level service standards and leading staff is requisite for this position."

 ## Step 5: Identify Essential Personality and Cultural Fit

 Beyond skills, identifying personal attributes is key to recruiting a Head Waiter who embodies your team ethos and customer engagement model. Avoid generic descriptions that offer limited insight.

 **Your goal is to depict the specific attitudes, interpersonal skills, and energy levels ideal for thriving in your establishment’s environment.**

 **1. Pinpoint successful traits within your team**

 Ask yourself:

- What characteristics do your top performers share?

- What types of personalities tend to struggle in your venue?

- Does your team share a high-energy, fast-paced dynamic or a calm and collected approach?

 List key adjectives or phrases that perfectly capture your team’s essence and expectations.

 **2. Articulate exact behavioural traits**

 Avoid “good communicator” in favour of specific details, such as:

- “Eager to engage and build rapport with guests”

- “Ensures effective collaboration and resolves conflicts smoothly”

- “Proactively supports colleagues and drives team spirit”

 **3. Align personality types with expected service intensity**

- If your establishment buzzes with frenetic energy: Seek poised individuals with composure under stress.

- If your setting encourages relaxed, engaging interaction: Prefer warm, confident communicators.

 **Example for a bustling, contemporary restaurant**

 "Candidates who excel in fast-paced, vibrant settings will thrive here. The ideal head waiter is proactive, quick-thinking, and contributes positively to team synergy. Effective collaboration and initiative are core parts of our service ethos."

 **Example for a more intimate venue**

 "An ideal candidate will exhibit excellent interpersonal warmth, maintaining welcoming engagement with guests. We value a supportive team player who demonstrates dedication to enhancing our customers' dining journey. A passion for food and wine is advantageous."

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Seek the perspectives of trusted staff about preferred co-workers.

- Reflect on past hiring successes and missteps for guidance.

- Remain truthful — if your venue has a chaotic charm, express the need for calm focus, not flexibility and an adaptable nature.

 ## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 Many businesses shy away from outlining pay and benefits, but this is critical. Comprehensive transparency promotes trust and aids in drawing suitable applicants by setting clear benchmarks for financial and non-financial rewards.

 **Explicitly declare:**

- The salary or pay package

- Any supplemental incentives or advantages on offer

- What makes employment there uniquely fulfilling

 **1. Openly share pay details — hourly or salaried**

 Specify the exact rate or practical spectrum. If in doubt:

- Research industry-standard pay scales for roles at equivalent venues.

- Confer with peers and utilise regional salary data from platforms like Indeed or Glassdoor.

- If pay scales based on experience, clearly state an expected range.

 Example:

 £13.00–£15.00 per hour based on experience
£2.00/hour in tips alongside base pay Sidestep terms like “competitive pay”—such ambiguity frustrates prospective hires.

 **2. Disclose any staff benefits**

 Perks, even minor, can sway potential hires. Extend your offer beyond mere salary details:

- Complementary dining or substantial discounts

- Times for breaks, paid if applicable

- Portions of tips or bonus schemes

- Occasional staff engagements outside work

- Emotional support or counsellor access

- Work hours flexibility or fixed rotas

- Paid holidays, particularly when exceeding the statutory minimum

 Example:

- 50% off on meals during working hours

- Pension scheme with employer contribution

- Free parking

- Team building and staff recognition events

- Cycle to work scheme

 **3. Mention opportunities for growth and learning (if available)**

 Express any structured training, mentorship, and potential for more senior roles.

 Example:

 We're dedicated to nurturing your growth, providing ample on-the-job training, support for further certifications, and a pathway to roles such as Maitre D' or Manager.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £13.50–£15.00 hourly, depending on experienceTips: £2.00/hr on top of base pay Benefits:

- Free staff meals and discounted dining

- 30 days paid leave, including bank holidays

- Employer-supported pension contributions

- Collaborative team dinners and celebratory events

- No late-night shifts beyond 10 pm

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask: “What distinguishes this role to ensure someone stays here?”

- Remain transparent typically about the limitations rather than overpromising.

- If salary isn’t leading the market, ensure other benefits illustrating a better work-life balance, team camaraderie, or training opportunities are highlighted.
