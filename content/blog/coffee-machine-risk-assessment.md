   - Coffee machine risk assessments are a legal requirement because they are a significant risk. In the UK, two main regulations apply - The Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR) apply to machines that store steam or pressurised water (which includes most espresso machines) and The&nbsp;Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) – these cover general equipment safety, including training, inspection, and safe use.
- The&nbsp;person doing the assessment should know the machine well (Head Barista or General Manager).
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built coffee machine risk assessment template&nbsp;which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## How to structure your coffee machine risk assessment&nbsp;

 Unlike a kitchen or front-of-house risk assessment, which has to cover a wide range of changing conditions and behaviours, a coffee machine risk assessment is much more focused. You’re not assessing a whole area — you’re assessing one specific piece of equipment, so there are fewer unknowns.

 This makes it easier to be accurate and thorough. With a coffee machine:

 - You already know where it’s located.
- You know who is using it.
- You know how it will be used, and how often.
- You have access to manufacturer instructions and servicing guidelines.
- You can plan inspections and training based on known risks — not guesswork.

 That makes this type of risk assessment more straightforward and easier to keep up to date — but no less important.

 In this help article, I’ll walk you through:

 - The common hazards linked to commercial coffee machines
- Who could be harmed and how
- What types of controls and precautions you should include
- What records and checks are legally required
- How to train staff and manage day-to-day safe use

 By the end, you’ll have a clear idea of what to include in your coffee machine risk assessment and a practical structure you can follow or adapt inside your Pilla template.&nbsp;

 Each section in this article is a piece of information or a hazard which you should consider adding to you risk assessment.

 ## 1. What is the model and manufacturer of the coffee machine to be assessed?

 This question is about identifying the specific machine in use so that its design, pressure capacity, servicing needs, and operational risks can be properly understood. You should record:

 - The make and model of the coffee machine
- The name of the manufacturer or supplier
- The serial number, if available
- Whether you own or rent the machine
- Where the machine is located on your premises

 This allows anyone reviewing the risk assessment (including regulators, insurers, or new team members) to understand exactly which piece of equipment the assessment applies to.

 Why it matters:Different coffee machines come with different pressure ratings, control designs, servicing requirements, and hazards. For example, a traditional two-group espresso machine with manual steam wands poses different risks than a bean-to-cup machine in a hotel breakfast area. The model you use will determine: - Whether it’s covered under the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR)
- The required frequency of inspection and maintenance
- The type of training needed
- What spare parts, maintenance schedules, and safety features are relevant
- Whether your risk assessment is compliant with PUWER and other legal obligations

 Recording this detail ensures your assessment is not generic, but tailored to your exact equipment.

 **What good answers look like:**

 You don’t need to write an essay here — a clear, specific response is enough. For example:

 “La Marzocco Linea Classic 2-group espresso machine
Serial No: LM0027834
Supplied by [Coffee Co] and installed May 2023
Located on the main bar at [Venue Name]
Owned by the business (not rented)” If you rent your machine or use a third-party servicing plan, include that here too — it helps when you later reference service agreements or responsibilities.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Start by physically checking the machine:

 - Look for the model plate, usually on the back or underneath
- Note the full product name, model number, and serial number
- Find out who supplied or installed it — was it a lease, a purchase, or part of a package?
- Add the exact location of the machine if you have multiple machines in different areas (e.g. bar, prep room, events kiosk)

 **Tip: **Attach a photo of the nameplate to the risk assessment record or store it in your equipment file.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Espresso machine” – This is too vague. It could refer to any number of makes or models. Your risk assessment must be linked to the specific unit in use.

 “La Marzocco” – Better, but still not detailed enough. You need the model and ideally the serial number for traceability.

 Forgetting to update the risk assessment when the machine is replaced – If you swap or upgrade machines, you need to review and update the risk assessment accordingly. Don’t let the record get out of date.

 ## 2. Who out of your workforce will use the coffee machine and how might they be harmed?

 This section is about identifying which roles in your team are expected to use the coffee machine — not individuals, but job titles or functions — and explaining how those people might realistically be harmed while using it.

 You’re doing two things here:

 1. $1
2. $1

 This matters because it helps you:

 - Understand who is exposed to the hazards of the equipment
- Tailor your training and supervision accordingly
- Prevent untrained staff using it during busy periods, cover shifts, or emergencies
- Make sure the people who use it have the right skills and protection in place

 **Why it matters**

 Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), only trained and competent people should use work equipment. If you haven’t clearly defined who those people are — and how they might be harmed — then it’s harder to:

 - Deliver effective safety training
- Enforce rules about who can and can’t use the equipment
- Investigate properly if something goes wrong

 It also helps you spot operational gaps. For example:

 - Do part-time or new staff end up using the machine without training?
- Do team leaders jump on the machine during peak periods, without formal sign-off?
- Are there tasks (e.g. cleaning, maintenance) where risks are higher but less visible?

 **What good answers look like**

 A good answer will:

 - List specific job roles, not people
- Include both regular users and those who might step in occasionally
- Note how each group might be harmed when using the machine
- Help you decide who needs training, supervision, or PPE

 Example:

 The machine is used daily by:

 - Baristas (main users) – risk of steam burns, contact with hot surfaces, electrical injury if machine is faulty
- Supervisors (cover users) – risk of scalds or misuse if unfamiliar with cleaning cycle or settings
- Assistant Managers (occasional use during opening or gaps) – risk of incorrect use if not up to date with training

 The following roles do not use the coffee machine and are not trained to do so:

 - Kitchen porters, waiting staff, delivery drivers, and cleaners

 **How to answer this for yourself**

 Ask:

 - Who uses the machine daily as part of their role?
- Who else might use it from time to time — during staff shortages or emergencies?
- Have there been incidents or near misses involving untrained users?
Could staff be harmed by:
Steam, boiling water, or hot surfaces?
Electrical faults or poor maintenance?
Improper cleaning methods or chemical exposure?- Steam, boiling water, or hot surfaces?
- Electrical faults or poor maintenance?
- Improper cleaning methods or chemical exposure?

 Use your rota, job descriptions, and incident reports to cross-check reality against your expectations. If this list surprises you — that’s a red flag.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)**

 “Everyone uses it.”
Very unlikely — and a major risk. Not all roles should have access. Define who should and make it clear who shouldn’t.“Baristas use it.”
Fine, but incomplete. If supervisors or assistant managers ever operate the machine, they must be included and trained too.Forgetting part-time, seasonal, or casual staff.
If they use the machine, they must be on the list — and trained accordingly.Letting untrained staff use the machine during busy periods.
If this happens often, review your cover procedures or widen training access in a controlled way.
 **Best practices to follow**

 - Use job titles, not names
- Include both primary and occasional users
- Be specific about how each group could be harmed
- Make it clear who is not authorised to use the machine
- Use this section to inform your training plan and SOPs
- Review and update this list if team structure or responsibilities change

 ## 3. Who else besides users could be harmed by the equipment, and how?

 Not every person at risk from a coffee machine will be the one using it. This section is about identifying anyone else — staff, visitors, or customers — who might be exposed to hazards from the machine simply by being nearby or working around it.

 The risks here are indirect, but no less important. You need to consider the layout of your space, how the machine is used during busy service, and whether others could come into contact with heat, steam, cables, or chemicals.

 **Why it matters**

 Health and safety law doesn’t just cover people operating the equipment — it applies to anyone who could be harmed by its use. If a staff member is burned walking past a hot surface, or a customer gets splashed by steam in an open kitchen, you’re still responsible.

 Common risks include:

 - Steam or hot water splashing onto nearby staff
- Scalds or burns from unguarded surfaces
- Slips caused by leaks or cleaning runoff
- Cleaning chemicals used near other workstations
- Customers reaching across exposed hot areas (e.g. at the service counter)

 **What good answers look like**

 Other people at risk include:

 - Waiting staff – may be scalded while reaching past the machine to collect drinks
- Cleaners – risk of electrical injury or burns during deep cleans if the machine isn’t properly isolated
- Customers – in open-plan settings, may be exposed to steam, hot surfaces, or spills if layout is not well designed
- Delivery drivers or engineers – could be harmed during handovers or while moving around a tight workspace

 **How to answer this for yourself**

 Ask:

 - Is the machine located in a shared space?
- Do other team members regularly walk past it during service?
- Could someone nearby be burned, shocked, or splashed by accident?
- Do customers or visitors ever stand close to the machine (e.g. at a counter or bar)?
- Could contractors or delivery staff be at risk if working in the same area?

 Walk the space during a busy shift — what hazards can you spot for people who aren’t using the machine?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)**

 “Only baristas are at risk.”
That’s rarely true — indirect exposure can still cause harm.“It’s never been a problem.”
Many accidents happen after long periods without incident. Don’t rely on past luck.“Cleaning staff know to be careful.”
You need a proper isolation procedure, not just verbal warnings.“We’ve never thought about customer proximity.”
In open kitchens or barista bars, customers can easily lean over or place belongings near the machine. That’s a burn risk.
 **Best practices to follow**

 - Assess risk to anyone who works near or walks past the machine
- Consider cleaning, maintenance, and shift overlap times — not just daytime service
- Train staff to enforce barriers or restricted zones
- Display warning signs where appropriate
- Avoid placing the machine where customers or passers-by can reach it
- Keep cables and cleaning chemicals safely out of the way of non-users

 ## 4. How was the coffee machine selected and deemed suitable for your working environment?

 This section asks you to explain how you chose the specific coffee machine model and whether it was suitable for the environment and tasks it’s used for.

 You should record:

 - Where the machine was purchased or leased from (approved supplier, manufacturer, second-hand, etc.)
- What checks were made to ensure it was appropriate for your venue
- Whether it meets safety standards (e.g. CE or UKCA marking)
- Whether the machine's capacity suits your service levels
- Who made the decision and whether the purchase followed any internal procedures

 **Why it matters:**

 PUWER requires employers to provide work equipment that is suitable for the task and for the conditions in which it is used.

 If your machine is underpowered for your customer volume, not designed for commercial use, or lacks safety certifications, it may:

 - Present risks of overheating, breakdown, or accidents
- Void your insurance if it fails and injures someone
- Fail to meet legal compliance, especially under UKCA/CE marking requirements

 A good procurement process ensures the machine is safe, fit-for-purpose, and able to meet the demands of your service without creating unnecessary risks.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - Where the machine came from
- What checks were made before purchase
- Whether the equipment is CE marked or UKCA marked
- Whether it’s designed for the type of service you run (e.g. all-day café, occasional brunches, etc.)
- Any procedures followed to approve the purchase

 **Example of a good answer:**

 “Machine supplied new by [Coffee Co] via approved commercial catering supplier.
Chosen based on manufacturer recommendation for volume (up to 250 drinks/day), with input from Head Barista and General Manager.
CE marked and meets UKCA requirements.
Purchasing decision reviewed by operations team and approved by company safety officer.” **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Was the machine bought new, second-hand, or leased?
- Did you check with your roaster, supplier, or another professional before choosing it?
- Was the machine designed for your type of venue (e.g. compact for limited space, or high-capacity for fast service)?
- Does the machine have safety markings (CE or UKCA)?
- Was the decision documented or reviewed internally?

 If you’re not sure, contact your supplier and ask them to confirm the safety certifications and recommended daily volume.

 Tip: If you bought your machine second-hand or inherited it with a site, take extra care to confirm its compliance with PSSR and PUWER.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “It was already here when we opened.” – That’s not enough. You still need to assess whether the machine is safe and appropriate for your operations.

 Buying second-hand equipment without checking its service history or safety certificates. – You need to know if it’s safe and compliant, especially if it’s a pressure vessel.

 Choosing based on price or aesthetics alone. – A machine may look good but might not be designed for high volume or intensive use.

 Not checking for UKCA or CE marks. – These markings confirm the equipment has been tested and meets safety standards. All machines sold in the UK must have UKCA or CE marking post-Brexit.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Source machines from reputable commercial equipment suppliers
- Ask for daily usage capacity, safety data, and compliance certificates before buying
- Ensure the machine is CE marked or UKCA marked
- Review safety and suitability with your barista team and management
- Keep a record of why the machine was chosen and any technical data received
- If unsure about suitability, request a site visit or spec sheet from your supplier

 ## 5. Service and Maintenance

 You need to describe what systems you have in place to ensure your coffee machine is serviced and maintained in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. This includes:

 - Who carries out the servicing
- How often the servicing is done
- What type of maintenance is performed
- What you do when a fault is found or a repair is needed
- How records are kept

 You should also mention what you do if the machine becomes unsafe or faulty — including how it's isolated, labelled, and taken out of use until repaired.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER), you have a duty to keep work equipment in efficient working order and good repair. If a coffee machine is left unmaintained, it can become dangerous — especially since many commercial machines operate under pressure, use electrical power, and reach high temperatures.

 Neglecting maintenance increases the risk of:

 - Scalds or burns from leaking steam or boiling water
- Electric shock from worn cables or internal faults
- Explosions or mechanical failure due to pressure buildup

 A clear and consistent maintenance system protects your team and ensures you meet your legal obligations.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - Who is responsible for arranging maintenance
- How often the machine is serviced
- Whether the service follows a manufacturer’s schedule
- How faults are reported and how unsafe equipment is dealt with
- Where service records are kept

 **Example of a thorough answer:**

 “The coffee machine is serviced quarterly by [Service Company Name], following the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance plan.
Internal staff also carry out daily cleaning and weekly checks on water filters, steam wands, and group heads.
Any faults are reported via our maintenance log, and the machine is isolated and labelled 'Do Not Use' until repaired.
Service certificates and maintenance records are stored digitally and checked during quarterly reviews.” **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Start by asking:

 - Do you follow the manufacturer's service schedule?
- Who services the machine — your team, a contractor, or the supplier?
- What happens if someone notices a fault?
- Do you have a way to isolate the machine and warn others not to use it?
- Are you keeping clear, accessible records of all servicing and repairs?

 **Tip**: Don’t rely on memory or verbal reminders. Maintenance should be a scheduled task with documented outcomes.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We clean it every day so it’s fine.”
Daily cleaning is important but not the same as professional maintenance. You need both. “We just get it serviced when something goes wrong.”
This is reactive and not compliant. You should follow a preventative maintenance schedule based on the manufacturer’s guidance. “The service engineer does it all – I don’t need to know.”
Even if you outsource servicing, you’re still responsible for knowing when it happens, what was done, and keeping records. “We don’t write anything down.”
Without maintenance records, you can’t prove the machine is safe to use — which puts you at risk during inspections or if an incident occurs. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Schedule servicing based on manufacturer intervals (e.g. every 3–6 months)
- Use a qualified technician with experience in pressure equipment
- Record each service date, the work done, and any parts replaced
- Create a fault reporting system that includes isolation procedures
- Display “Out of Order” signs when a machine is unsafe or waiting for repair
- Keep service records accessible (digital files or paper logs)

 ## 6. Pressure System Examination

 You need to confirm whether your coffee machine is covered by a Written Scheme of Examination (WSE) and explain how this requirement is being met. A WSE is a formal document that outlines how a pressure system (such as a coffee machine boiler) must be inspected to ensure it is safe to operate.

 The WSE is a legal requirement under the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR) for machines where steam is used under pressure. This includes nearly all commercial espresso machines.

 Your answer should include:

 - Whether your machine falls under PSSR
- Who the “competent person” is (the person conducting the examination)
- Whether the WSE is part of your rental or insurance agreement
- How often the examination is done (usually annually or every 14 months)
- Where the examination record is kept

 **Why it matters:**

 Espresso machines operate under pressure and can be dangerous if their components fail. The boiler, steam wand, safety valve, and pressure gauge all need to be regularly examined by someone qualified to detect wear, corrosion, or defects that aren’t obvious through normal servicing.

 The WSE is not the same as a service. A service keeps the machine running well. A WSE ensures it is fundamentally safe under pressure.

 If an explosion or serious injury occurs and no WSE is in place, the consequences could include prosecution, insurance claims being denied, or even closure of your premises.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A strong answer should confirm:

 - That your machine is covered by a written scheme of examination
- Who created and carries out the WSE
- How frequently the examination happens
- Where the certificate is stored
- Whether it’s part of a rental, service, or insurance agreement

 **Example of a thorough answer:**

 “Our espresso machine has a boiler over 0.5 bar pressure, so it falls under PSSR.
A Written Scheme of Examination is provided by our insurance company and the annual examination is carried out by an independent pressure system engineer.
The engineer is not the same person who performs the routine servicing.
Certification is stored in our health and safety folder and logged digitally in Pilla.
The last inspection was carried out on [insert date], next due [insert date].” **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Does your machine use pressurised steam? (If yes, you likely fall under PSSR.)
- Are you renting the machine? If so, is the WSE included in your agreement?
- If you own the machine, have you spoken to your insurance provider about arranging a competent person for inspection?
- Is the person conducting the exam independent from the routine service provider?
- Do you have a physical or digital copy of the WSE and certificate?

 Tip: The WSE should cover what needs inspecting, how often, how it should be tested, and what the safe operating limits are. Keep it easily accessible for reference or inspection.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We already get the machine serviced – that’s enough.”
Servicing and examination are not the same. Servicing maintains performance. A WSE is a safety inspection carried out by a certified and independent person. “Our machine’s too small to need one.”
Most commercial espresso machines fall under PSSR due to their pressure and volume. Always check — don’t assume. “It’s rented so we don’t need to worry about it.”
Even if you rent the machine, you’re still responsible for ensuring the WSE is in place and up to date. Confirm this with your supplier. “We don’t keep the certificate.”
If you don’t have a copy of the certificate and inspection record, you can’t prove compliance. This is a serious issue during inspections or claims. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Always check whether your espresso machine is covered by PSSR (if it holds steam over 0.5 bar, it usually is)
- Ensure a Written Scheme of Examination is in place and updated every 14 months or sooner if required
- Use a competent and independent inspector (not your routine service technician)
- Store your WSE certificate and inspection records in a clearly labelled digital or physical folder
- Review the findings of the last examination — make sure any recommendations or defects were addressed

 ## 7. Inspections to Ensure Safe Use

 This section asks you to explain what checks or inspections are carried out in your business to ensure the coffee machine is being used safely, and who is responsible for those checks.

 It’s not asking about formal engineering inspections (that’s covered in Section 5). This section is about routine, in-house checks — things that your managers or supervisors do to make sure the machine is being operated properly and not being misused.

 **Why it matters:**

 Just because a machine is in good working order doesn’t mean it’s being used safely. A staff member can operate a machine incorrectly, skip cleaning steps, or bypass safety features. That’s why it’s important to regularly observe and inspect usage — not just the equipment itself.

 These checks are part of your duty of care as an employer under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and PUWER (Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998). Both require employers to monitor how equipment is used, and to take steps to prevent unsafe practices.

 Regular in-house inspections also help identify training gaps and reduce wear and tear on the machine by catching misuse early.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A strong answer will explain:

 - What kind of checks are carried out (e.g. visual checks, use observations)
- How often they happen (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly)
- Who is responsible (e.g. manager, head barista)
- What is done if something unsafe is spotted (e.g. retraining, fault reporting)
- Whether checklists or logs are used

 **Example of a good answer:**

 “The Front of House Manager visually inspects the espresso machine every morning during opening checks to ensure it’s clean, fully assembled, and no error lights are showing.
During service, the Head Barista supervises usage and corrects any unsafe handling (e.g. incorrect milk jug cleaning, misuse of hot water tap).
Staff are reminded during shift briefings about key safety behaviours.
Any safety concerns or faults are reported in Pilla using our equipment log.” **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Start by asking:

 - Do managers or senior staff do daily opening/closing checks on the coffee machine?
- Is anyone responsible for observing how staff use the machine during service?
- Is there a clear process for spotting and correcting unsafe behaviour?
- Do you use a checklist, or is it done informally?
- If someone sees a dangerous practice, do they know how to report it and follow up?

 Tip: These don’t need to be long, formal inspections. What matters is that someone is actively checking and intervening when needed. It shows you’re taking reasonable steps to keep people safe.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don’t need checks — staff are experienced.”
Even experienced staff can get complacent. Regular checks reinforce expectations and catch bad habits early. “We only inspect the machine, not how it’s used.”
You’re responsible for both. If someone gets scalded while misusing the steam wand, that’s still your risk to manage. “We don’t record anything.”
You don’t need a huge paper trail, but a quick log in your daily checklist or work app like Pilla is good practice. If something’s checked, make a note. “We tell people to let us know if something’s wrong.”
That’s reactive. Inspections should be proactive — don’t wait for problems to be reported. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Build coffee machine checks into your daily opening and closing routines
- Train team leaders or managers to observe safe use during service
- Use a simple checklist or log to confirm checks are being done
- Encourage a culture where unsafe use is corrected in the moment (e.g. poor wand technique, skipping cleaning steps)
- Set a clear process for reporting and responding to safety concerns
- Use shift briefings or weekly catchups to reinforce safe use and remind staff of best practice

 ## 8. Information, instruction, and training.

 You need to describe what training has been provided to your staff to ensure they can use the coffee machine safely and competently. This includes:

 - How to operate the machine during service
- How to clean and maintain it safely
- How to spot faults or unsafe conditions
- What&nbsp;to do if something goes wrong

 You need to also describe how training is delivered (in-house or external), how it's recorded, and whether any written instructions or signage is provided.&nbsp;

 When a new Barista starts a job in your business, you should have a schedule for the training like this [Barista onboarding training template](https://yourpilla.com/templates/barista-onboarding-training) in Pilla. As part of that training, you should have a checklist to make sure that the new user of the machine understands it fully. This training checklist, like the Pilla [coffee machine training checklist template](https://yourpilla.com/templates/1745228645617x739208909613432800) can also be used to refresh staff on safe coffee machine use or can be used to train staff on new coffee machines.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER (Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998), you have a legal duty to ensure that anyone who uses work equipment has received adequate training.

 This is especially important for espresso machines, which pose risks to users of the machine and people nearby. If your team aren’t properly trained, these hazards become real safety risks — and if an incident occurs and there’s no training record, it could be a serious compliance breach.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - Who receives the training
- What’s included in the training
- How the training is delivered (in-house, external, or both)
- How training is recorded and stored
- What written instructions are available (signage, manuals, SOPs)

 **Example of a thorough answer:**

 There's no need to go overboard and complicate your detail in answers, bullet points like the below are good practice.

 - “All baristas are trained in-house by the Head Barista before using the machine. Training includes daily startup/shutdown checks, safe steam wand operation, cleaning, and fault reporting.&nbsp;
- Staff also receive descaling and maintenance training once they've worked for 4 weeks. External pressure system safety training is provided annually by [Training Company].
- Training is recorded in each team member’s onboarding checklist and added to their digital file.
- A&nbsp;written SOP is displayed above the machine and reviewed annually.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Start by asking:

 - Who in your team is expected to use the machine?
- Do&nbsp;they receive any formal training, or just on-the-job coaching?
- Have&nbsp;you written down the key steps to using and cleaning the machine safely?
- Do&nbsp;new team members get a proper induction that includes coffee machine safety?
- Have&nbsp;you ever brought in external training for pressure equipment?

 **Tip: **Even informal, in-house training should be documented and repeatable. Write out what’s taught and when. Store it in your training records so you can prove it’s been done.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We show new starters how to use it on their first day.” - This is too vague. If it’s not structured and not recorded, it won’t hold up if there’s an accident or inspection.

 “The machine is self-explanatory.” - Never assume that because something seems simple, it’s safe to use without training. Espresso machines operate under pressure and can cause serious injuries.

 “We haven’t needed training, no one’s been hurt.” - The absence of accidents doesn’t mean you're compliant. Training is a proactive legal requirement, not just a reactive one.

 “We train people verbally but don’t write anything down.” - If training isn’t recorded, it’s as if it never happened in the eyes of a regulator or insurance provider.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Create a standard onboarding checklist for baristas that includes coffee machine safety like this Barista onboarding training template
- Develop or download a step-by-step SOP for using and cleaning the machine
- Include manufacturer’s instructions as part of staff training
- If descaling is required, give separate training for this and explain any chemical hazards
- Make sure you include a system for retraining — e.g., annually or after incidents

 ## 9. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

 PPE should be considered a last line of defence, used only when the risks can’t be controlled in other ways. But for coffee machines, there are some tasks — like deep cleaning or descaling — where PPE may still be appropriate and necessary.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, you’re legally required to:

 - Provide suitable PPE when other control measures aren’t enough
- Make sure it’s used correctly
- Train staff to use it and check it’s in good condition

 With coffee machines, risks such as chemical burns from cleaning fluids, scalds from steam, or minor cuts during maintenance might justify using PPE for certain tasks.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Good answers should identify:

 - What PPE is used (e.g. gloves, goggles, aprons)
- When it’s used (e.g. during daily cleaning, descaling, or maintenance)
- Who is expected to wear it
- How staff are trained to use it correctly
- Where PPE is stored and how it's replaced if damaged

 Bullet points work well here.

 **Example of a thorough answer:**

 - Heat-resistant gloves are used when cleaning the group heads or steam wand after service.
- Single-use nitrile gloves and safety goggles are provided for descaling to protect against chemical splashes.
- Aprons are worn during cleaning to protect from hot water or cleaning products.
- PPE is stored in a labelled container near the cleaning station.
- Staff receive training during onboarding on when and how to use PPE correctly.
- PPE use is included in daily closing checklists and monitored by the Duty Manager.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Are there any parts of using or cleaning the machine that expose staff to burns, splashes, or chemicals?
- Have you provided PPE, or are staff just making do?
- Are staff aware of when to use PPE, or is it unclear?
- Is PPE readily available, labelled, and replaced when needed?
- Do you record any training or reminders about PPE use?

 Tip: Check your cleaning products — if any have COSHH hazard symbols (e.g. irritant or corrosive), PPE should be mandatory when using them.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don’t use PPE because the risks are low.”
Even for low-risk equipment, cleaning fluids or hot components can justify PPE. If you’re not using any, be sure you’ve justified that decision properly. “Staff wear gloves when they remember.”
PPE use should be consistent, not optional. If it’s not written down, taught, or monitored, it likely won’t be used reliably. “We just use normal washing-up gloves.”
Make sure the PPE is suitable for the hazard — e.g. chemical-resistant gloves for descaling, not just household rubber gloves. “We have some gloves somewhere in the cupboard.”
PPE needs to be accessible, stored properly, and replaced if damaged. Having it hidden or forgotten defeats the purpose. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Add PPE use to your cleaning or descaling SOPs
- Train staff on how and when to use it
- Keep a visible storage area near the machine for gloves, aprons, and goggles
- Use signs or labels to prompt PPE use where needed
- Include PPE checks in your daily or weekly equipment routines

 ## 10. Are the Controls to Use the Coffee Machine Safe and Easy to Use?

 In this section, you need to explain how the buttons, switches, levers, or dials on your coffee machine are safe, intuitive, and accessible for staff to use. The focus is on usability and safety, especially under pressure during service.

 Controls should be easy to understand, clearly labelled, and located in logical places. You should also mention any emergency stop functions and how staff are expected to use them.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER (Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998), equipment controls must:

 - Be clearly identifiable
- Be easy to access and operate safely
- Include a method for stopping the machine safely and quickly if needed

 During busy service, even experienced baristas can make mistakes if the controls are confusing, worn out, or unlabelled. Good control layout prevents accidents like burns from steam, spills from misoperation, or damage to the machine.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer will include:

 - A description of the control layout (buttons, steam lever, touchscreen, etc.)
- Any safety features (e.g. auto shut-off, pressure indicators, emergency stop)
- Whether controls are clearly marked or colour-coded
- How staff are trained to use them
- How the condition of the controls is checked

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - All control buttons on our machine are clearly labelled and backlit.
- The steam wand has a spring-loaded lever which automatically closes when released, reducing the risk of scalds.
- The hot water dispenser has a separate button with a delay to prevent accidental dispensing.
- Pressure gauge is visible and monitored during service.
- An emergency stop button is located next to the power socket and is tested weekly.
- Baristas are trained during onboarding on all controls and shown what to do if anything becomes unresponsive or faulty.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Are your machine’s controls easy to identify and reach during a busy shift?
- Could someone unfamiliar with the machine figure out what each button does?
- Are there labels or icons? Are they still visible or have they worn off?
- Does the machine have automatic shutoffs or safety levers?
- Is there an emergency stop function, and do staff know how to use it?
- When was the last time you checked the condition of the buttons or switches?

 If your machine has touchscreen controls, are they responsive and visible in low light or under steam? Are all software settings locked down so only trained staff can change them?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We’ve had the machine for years, the baristas know it inside out.”
That’s fine for current staff, but not for new starters or during inspections. If controls are worn out or unlabelled, it increases risk. “The steam wand is hard to shut off quickly.”
This is a burn hazard. If a lever sticks or requires two hands to operate, you need to fix or replace it. “We don’t have a dedicated emergency stop.”
If there’s no clear way to shut off the machine in an emergency, especially for high-pressure systems, that’s a compliance issue. “There’s a pressure gauge but nobody really checks it.”
Then it’s not doing its job. If safety features exist, staff need to be trained to monitor and use them. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Check that labels and icons are intact and readable
- Make sure steam, water, and brew controls are responsive and don’t stick
- Test the emergency stop regularly — and make sure staff know how to use it
- Include a control function check in your opening/closing checklists
- Add a control overview to your training SOP and onboarding documents

 ## 11. How the Coffee Machine is Isolated from Sources of Power

 This section is about explaining how your coffee machine can be safely and completely shut down from all power sources — including electricity, steam, and (if applicable) gas or water supply.

 You need to describe how isolation is done, who is authorised to do it, where the isolation points are, and whether they are accessible, clearly marked, and tested regularly.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER 1998, any piece of equipment must be capable of being completely and safely isolated from all energy sources. This is critical when:

 - Carrying out cleaning or maintenance
- Responding to a fault or emergency
- Preventing accidental activation during service work

 Without proper isolation, there's a real risk of electric shock, burns, pressure-related accidents, or equipment damage.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - Where the isolation switches are located
- Which sources of power are involved (e.g. electric, steam, water)
- How isolation is done (e.g. switch, plug, emergency shut-off)
- Whether staff are trained in isolation procedures
- Whether there’s a system to label faulty machines as out of use

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Our machine runs on mains electricity and mains water.
- A dedicated wall-mounted isolation switch is located directly above the machine and labelled ‘Coffee Machine Power’.
- The water supply has a shut-off valve under the counter.
- In the event of a fault, staff unplug the machine and leave a “Do Not Use” sign on it until inspected.
- During deep cleans or maintenance, only the manager or duty technician isolates power and water using the switch and valve.
- Emergency stop button is installed next to the grinder panel.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - What sources of energy does your machine use? (Electricity? Steam boiler? Water pressure?)
- Where are the isolation points? Are they easily accessible or behind fixtures?
- Can a member of staff isolate the machine without needing tools?
- Do you have a clear step-by-step process for isolating power safely?
- Are machines labelled clearly when they’re out of order?

 If isolation relies on unplugging the machine, is the plug accessible, or is it buried behind cabinets? If a water supply needs to be turned off, is there a dedicated valve nearby?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “The plug is behind a fixed unit, we’d have to move the machine.”
That’s not good enough. Isolation points need to be quickly and safely accessible — especially in emergencies. “We just turn the machine off at the control panel.”
That’s not isolation. You’re only powering it down — energy may still be flowing. True isolation means removing or cutting off the power source entirely. “Only the engineer knows where the shut-off valve is.”
That’s a risk. Your team needs to know how to isolate the equipment if something goes wrong during service. “There’s no signage on the isolation switch.”
That creates confusion. Label all isolation points clearly so they’re used properly and confidently. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Make sure isolation switches and valves are clearly marked and easily accessible
- Add photos or diagrams to your health and safety file showing where isolation points are
- Include isolation steps in your machine shutdown SOP or cleaning procedures
- Train staff during onboarding on how to isolate power and water to the machine
- When machines are out of order, use a “Do Not Use” sign or physical lock-off system

 ## 12. Is the Equipment Housed So It Is Stable?

 This section is about explaining how your coffee machine is secured in place so that it cannot tip, shift, or fall during use, cleaning, or maintenance. You need to describe what makes the machine stable — the surface, fixings, or any additional supports — and whether you’ve assessed the likelihood of movement under normal working conditions.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER 1998, equipment must be stable and secure in the environment where it’s used. Espresso machines, especially dual-group commercial models, can be very heavy — and combined with the vibrations from operation or knocks during busy service, there’s a real risk of equipment movement or tipping if not properly housed.

 Unstable machines can:

 - Fall or shift, injuring staff
- Disconnect from water or power, causing leaks or faults
- Increase risk of burns from hot liquid spills
- Compromise the safe operation of pressure systems

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - The type of surface the machine sits on (e.g. stainless steel counter, fixed wooden unit)
- Whether the machine is bolted, clamped, or secured in another way
- If the surface is level, strong enough, and vibration-resistant
- How the layout reduces the risk of bumping or accidental impact
- Whether stability is checked during setup, cleaning or maintenance

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - The coffee machine is a 2-group commercial model weighing approx. 65kg.
- It is placed on a fixed stainless steel counter that is bolted to the wall and floor.
- Rubber vibration pads are fitted under the machine to reduce slipping.
- The counter is level and rated to hold up to 100kg.
- The machine is not moved during daily use — repositioning is only done by engineers during service.
- Stability is checked by the manager after deep cleans and any layout changes.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - What surface does the machine sit on? Is it flat, stable, and strong enough for the weight?
- Has the machine ever moved or shifted position? Could it slide if knocked?
- Are there vibration pads or anti-slip fixings in place?
- Does your layout make it likely that someone could bump or lean on the machine during service?
- Has anyone ever had to steady the machine while using it?

 Check whether your equipment is rated for the weight of the machine — especially if it’s placed on a non-commercial unit or a wheeled trolley.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “It just sits on a standard wooden counter.”
That might not be strong or stable enough for a heavy coffee machine. Domestic counters often warp or shift under vibration and heat. “We haven’t had a problem, so we assume it’s fine.”
Visual checks aren’t enough. A machine might slowly slide or lean without tipping — but that’s still unsafe. “It’s on a movable trolley so we can clean behind it.”
Unless locked and properly stabilised, trolleys introduce risk. If using a movable unit, it must have brakes, locks, or clamps to prevent movement during use. “The machine wobbles slightly when it’s running.”
Even a small amount of movement can lead to leaks, wear on connections, or injury over time. You need to fix the cause, not ignore it. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Place machines on a permanently fixed counter made of non-flammable, heat-resistant material
- Use vibration pads or anti-slip mats under the feet of the machine
- Ensure the counter is rated for the weight of the machine plus any accessories
- Avoid placing the machine at the edge of counters or near high-traffic walkways
- Conduct a stability check annually or after any changes to layout or equipment

 ## 13. Is the lighting where the equipment is used suitable and sufficient?

 This section is about explaining whether the lighting in the area where the coffee machine is used is good enough to allow staff to operate, clean, and maintain the machine safely. You should describe the type of lighting, where it’s positioned, and how it helps reduce the risk of mistakes or injury.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER 1998, employers must ensure that work equipment is used in suitable lighting conditions. Good lighting isn’t just about visibility — it helps staff:

 - Spot hazards like steam, spills, or cracks
- Read machine settings and warning lights
- Perform safe cleaning and descaling
- Identify wear, damage, or potential faults

 Poor lighting increases the risk of burns, scalds, electrical incidents, and incorrect operation.

 This applies to both ambient lighting (general overhead light) and task lighting (focused light directly over the machine).

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - What type of lighting is used (e.g. LED, halogen, task lamp)
- Where the light sources are positioned in relation to the machine
- Whether lighting levels are sufficient during all shifts (including night service)
- Whether bulbs are regularly checked and replaced
- How lighting supports safe operation, cleaning, and maintenance

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - The machine is located under an overhead LED light, with 500-lumen brightness.
- Additional task lighting is mounted under the shelving unit above the machine.
- This ensures baristas can clearly see control panels, steam wands, and drip trays.
- Lighting is checked weekly and replaced as needed by the maintenance team.
- There are no shadows or glare that interfere with safe operation.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Start by standing at the machine during normal service — is everything clearly visible?

 Ask:

 - Can staff see the pressure gauge, buttons, and portafilter clearly?
- Are there shadows cast by overhead units or shelving?
- What happens when one of the bulbs goes out — does it affect visibility?
- Can staff clean behind or underneath the machine with current lighting?

 If your machine is near a window, also consider how daylight changes during early mornings or night shifts.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “The machine is in a well-lit room, that’s enough.”
General room lighting doesn’t guarantee safe use. You need to assess visibility at the machine, not just in the room overall. “It’s fine during the day.”
What about early shifts or winter evenings? Lighting should be sufficient at all operating times. “Staff just use a torch from their phone when cleaning behind it.”
That’s a sign lighting is insufficient. Relying on ad-hoc lighting increases risk and breaks best practice. “We’ve never had a problem with lighting.”
That doesn’t mean the lighting is compliant or safe. Regular checks are essential. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Install bright, non-glare overhead lights above the machine
- Add task lighting if overhead light is blocked by shelving or other units
- Check lighting levels during different shifts and times of day
- Create a bulb check rota as part of weekly equipment checks
- Ensure lighting is sufficient for safe cleaning and maintenance, not just operation
- Consider emergency lighting nearby in case of power failure

 ## 14. Are there markings or warning signage displayed on the equipment or required?

 In this section, you need to describe any warning signs, labels, or safety markings that are already on the coffee machine — or that should be added based on your risk assessment.

 This includes any manufacturer-applied stickers (e.g. “Hot Surface”), electrical warnings, or signage you’ve added locally to promote safe use, cleaning, or shutdown.

 **Why it matters:**

 According to both PUWER 1998 and general health and safety best practice, appropriate warning signs must be visible and understood by all staff.

 Clear safety markings help staff:

 - Recognise dangerous parts (e.g. steam wand, boiler casing)
- Avoid burns, scalds, or electric shock
- Follow hygiene or PPE procedures (e.g. “Gloves required for descaling”)
- Take correct actions in an emergency (e.g. “Emergency Stop Button”)

 These signs become even more important for new starters or temporary staff who may not be familiar with the equipment layout or risks.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer explains:

 - What safety signage is already on the equipment (manufacturer-applied)
- What local signage has been added by your team
- Where signage is placed (e.g. above machine, on wall, behind casing)
- Whether the signs are clear, clean, and legible
- If signs are routinely checked for wear or damage
- Whether any additional signage is recommended

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - The espresso machine has built-in “Hot Surface” warnings on the group heads and steam wand.
- We’ve added a laminated sign above the machine reminding staff to wash hands before use and to wear gloves when descaling.
- An electrical safety warning is displayed on the plug socket behind the machine.
- All signage is reviewed monthly by the Duty Manager and replaced if faded.
- We plan to add a “Do not use if fault lights are flashing” sign next to the display panel.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Stand at the machine and ask:

 - What built-in warnings are already visible on the equipment?
- Have any labels worn off or become unreadable over time?
- Are there additional risks you’ve identified during your risk assessment that need signage?
- Do staff have clear visual prompts for cleaning, PPE, or safe shutdown?
- Could someone unfamiliar with the machine use it safely based on the signage alone?

 Tip: Use clear, pictogram-style signage where possible. This makes instructions easier to understand for non-native English speakers.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “There are stickers from the manufacturer, so we’re covered.”
Manufacturer warnings are a baseline — they don’t cover your specific processes or venue setup. You may still need to add local signage based on your risk assessment. “The signs are faded but still visible.”
Faded signs can’t be relied on in low light or emergency situations. Replace them promptly. “We tell staff what to do, we don’t need signs.”
Signage supports training and reduces human error — especially for new staff, cover shifts, or high-pressure situations. “We’ve got lots of signs so we’re safe.”
Too many signs can become visual clutter. Focus on relevant, clear signage placed in the right locations. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Check the machine for manufacturer safety stickers (hot surface, electrical danger, etc.)
Add clear local signage if needed for:
PPE (e.g. gloves for descaling)
Cleaning reminders
Emergency shut-off procedures
“Do not use” or fault warnings- PPE (e.g. gloves for descaling)
- Cleaning reminders
- Emergency shut-off procedures
- “Do not use” or fault warnings
- Mount signs at eye level, near key controls
- Keep signage clean, legible, and up to date
- Review signage quarterly as part of your regular equipment checks

 ## 15. Are there any further control measures you will use to protect those who use the work equipment which has been assessed?

 This final section asks you to step back and think: Have you covered everything? Are there any gaps?

 You’ve already looked at hazards, maintenance, training, signage, and safe systems of work — now it’s time to tie everything together and add any final controls you think are necessary to reduce the risk.

 This section should include any follow-up actions you identified earlier in your risk assessment — for example, if you mentioned that staff training isn’t currently recorded, here is where you say you’ll implement that.

 **Why it matters:**

 This section helps you close the loop. Most risk assessments reveal something that isn’t currently being done but probably should be — this is your place to capture that and make a plan.

 By showing that you’ve thought critically about remaining risks and taken further steps, you strengthen your compliance and improve safety for your team.

 It’s also a chance to show that you’re proactive, not just ticking boxes.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer might include:

 - New training records you’re going to introduce
- Replacing worn-out signage or labels
- Upgrading equipment with better safety features
- Booking a thorough examination with a competent person
- Writing or updating your SOPs (standard operating procedures)
- Adding reminders to your digital calendar or system to ensure regular checks

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - We’re creating a short SOP for using and cleaning the machine, which will be printed and displayed above the unit.
- Our maintenance provider confirmed the machine needs a written scheme of examination. We’ve booked a certified engineer for next month.
- We’ve ordered new “Hot Surface” stickers to replace faded labels.
- All staff will now complete a short safety checklist during onboarding, and the training will be recorded in their digital files.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Did I mention anything earlier that needs to be done but isn’t in place yet?
- Are there actions I can take that would further reduce risk or improve consistency?
- Is there anything I’d be embarrassed to admit during an HSE inspection?
- Do I have a clear way of tracking this risk assessment going forward?

 Tip: Don’t worry about making this perfect. Just make it practical. Think about what needs fixing or improving — then write it down here so you can follow through.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don’t need any more controls.”
That’s rare. Even a well-run business usually has one or two things they can tighten up — especially around training records, signage, or servicing. “We’ll deal with that later.”
If it’s not written down here, it often doesn’t happen. Use this section as a to-do list and make sure someone is responsible for each task. “I’m not sure what else to include.”
Go back through each section of your risk assessment and look for anything you weren’t completely sure about. This is your place to add follow-up actions. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Review your entire risk assessment before completing this section
- Capture follow-up tasks and assign them clearly
- Be honest — this isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being responsible
- Include target dates and review points if possible
- Update this section when you review the risk assessment in future
