## Day 1: Foundation and Kitchen Integration
The first day focuses on creating a solid foundation for the aboyeur role whilst integrating the new hire into your kitchen's specific systems and culture.

This foundation day ensures your new aboyeur understands the kitchen's operational flow, team dynamics, and their crucial role in coordinating service excellence.

**Kitchen Systems and Layout Orientation**

Why it's essential:
The aboyeur must understand every aspect of kitchen operations to coordinate effectively. Without comprehensive system knowledge, coordination becomes reactive rather than proactive.

| Brigade Structure Introduction | Introduce each team member, their roles, and reporting relationships | Clarify the aboyeur's position within the hierarchy |
| Communication Systems | Demonstrate kitchen display systems, POS integration, and verbal communication protocols | Practice using all communication tools |
| Service Flow Overview | Explain typical service progression from prep through close | Show how coordination needs change throughout service |

**Team Integration and Role Clarification**

Understanding team dynamics and establishing respect is crucial for aboyeur success.

Key activities:

| Element | Instructions | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Meet Each Station Chef | Formal introductions with discussion of each station's specialties | Encourage questions about timing and coordination preferences |
| Shadow Current Coordinator | Observe existing coordination during prep and early service | Take notes on communication patterns and timing methods |
