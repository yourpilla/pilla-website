title: How to use 'clean as you go' in your hospitality business.
---
Clean as you go is a cleaning technique. It helps to improve hygiene, health, and safety. Clean as you go is the safest and easiest method to use in cleaning, especially in hospitality businesses or retail businesses where food in present and food hygiene standards need to be monitored. 
Food soiling and debris is potential food and a growing medium for micro-organisms, as well as being a potential food supply for pests, so it must be removed as quickly as possible. It is easier to clean if this is undertaken immediately after soiling because a build-up of food residues and soiling will make it more difficult to remove later. So, the clean as you go method involves cleaning continuously throughout the working day. It means cleaning will become a part of your daily routine. Clean as you go method ensures that all surfaces, equipment, premises etc., are clean, sterile, and clutter-free all the time.

 ## The clean as you go method

 This is the recommended way of keeping your kitchen clean. Not only does it help to ensure food hygiene it can also help to improve health and safety. It is the safest and easiest method to keep your kitchen clean and safe as you work. This is especially important in hospitality businesses or retail businesses where high standards of food hygiene are not only a legal requirement but are expected by customers.
Unfortunately, I have inspected many businesses that do not follow this method, kitchens are messy and disorganised. This makes it much harder to ensure food hygiene and the Environmental Health Officer may not have confidence in how you are managing food safety. It is worth noting that food soiling and debris can provide a potential growing medium for micro-organisms, as well as being a potential food supply for pests, so it must be removed as quickly as possible. It is easier to clean if undertaken immediately after soiling because a build-up of food residues and soiling will make it more difficult to remove later. A cleaning kit, standard cleaning equipment, disposable gloves, paper towels and cleaning chemicals are all necessary for an effective cleaning strategy.

 I can't tell you how many times I've seen filthy mops and brooms in use. Make sure your cleaning equipment is kept clean.I have inspected food businesses where huge amounts of food debris, grease and dirt have been left to accumulate under equipment and in the corners of floor edges. The cleaning in such businesses does not meet the food hygiene standards required. It also means that they have a much bigger task on their hands when they receive a low food hygiene rating and are given a very short time frame to undergo a deep clean.

 There are also situations where a food business may get closed down if standards of cleaning are so poor that they pose an 'imminent risk' to the health of the public. In my experience, poor cleaning goes hand in hand with a pest infestation.Environmental Health Officers will check the standard of cleaning under equipment and around floor edges and they know the difference between dirt and debris that has appeared during service and that which has been there for weeks or months!
