## Step 1: Define Your Restaurant Environment
When writing a restaurant host job description, start by painting a clear picture of your restaurant's service environment and guest interaction expectations. The restaurant host role varies dramatically between venues, so candidates must understand the specific hospitality context they'll be entering.

The restaurant host serves as the first point of contact for guests, responsible for creating positive first impressions, managing arrivals, and setting the tone for the entire dining experience. Without understanding your restaurant's atmosphere, service philosophy, and guest expectations, candidates can't assess whether their hospitality approach matches your needs.

**Your goal is to help candidates understand:**

- Your restaurant's service style and guest demographic
- The type of guest interactions and hospitality requirements
- The operational demands and coordination responsibilities
- The atmosphere and presentation standards expected

Use this 3-part approach:

**1. Define Your Restaurant Type and Guest Profile**

Be specific about your establishment: "We operate a contemporary fine dining restaurant serving discerning guests who expect sophisticated hospitality / run a vibrant neighbourhood bistro welcoming families and casual diners / manage a busy city centre restaurant with diverse clientele and fast-paced service..."

Give candidates concrete details about your service model:

- Do you focus on formal, elegant service or casual, friendly interactions?
- Are you managing intimate dining experiences or high-volume guest flow?
- Do you operate with reservation systems, walk-in service, or both?
- What's your average cover count and guest interaction volume?

**2. Describe Your Service Philosophy and Hospitality Standards**

Explain the guest relations approach and hospitality philosophy that drives your restaurant. The host's role changes significantly based on service expectations:

- "Our hospitality philosophy emphasises warm, professional welcome that creates memorable first impressions whilst ensuring seamless guest experience coordination."

- "We focus on efficient, friendly service that makes every guest feel valued whilst maintaining smooth operations and table turnover optimization."

- "Our host delivers sophisticated hospitality that reflects our fine dining standards through elegant guest relations and attention to detail."

- "We operate with approachable hospitality that creates welcoming atmosphere for diverse guests whilst coordinating effective service delivery."

Detail the specific hospitality elements your host will manage:

- How many guest arrivals and departures occur during peak periods?
- Do you offer special services like coat check, valet coordination, or guest amenities?
- Are there VIP protocols, special occasion services, or guest recognition programmes?
- What makes your guest experience unique in your market segment?

**3. Highlight Your Restaurant Atmosphere and Working Environment**

Showcase the hospitality environment and team coordination:

- "Our restaurant host operates in elegant dining environment, coordinating with service team to ensure sophisticated guest experiences and seamless table management."

- "We operate vibrant hospitality atmosphere where hosts work collaboratively with servers and management to create positive guest experiences."

- "Our hospitality team creates welcoming environment through professional presentation, guest attention, and coordination with kitchen and service staff."

- "The host position manages guest relations in dynamic restaurant environment, coordinating between different service areas and maintaining positive atmosphere."

**Tips if you're unsure**

To get started, answer these questions comprehensively:

- How many guests do you typically seat during different service periods?
- How many host staff work during various shifts and what's their coordination?
- Do you operate formal or casual hospitality and guest interaction approaches?
- What's the complexity level of your reservation systems and guest requirements?
- How does guest information flow between host station and service teams?
- What makes your guest relations challenging or unique compared to other restaurants?
- Do you have special protocols for VIP guests, celebrations, or group reservations?
- How does your host coordinate with servers, management, and kitchen during service?

**Additional considerations for your environment description:**

- Guest demographics: Are you serving business diners, families, tourists, or special occasion guests?
- Service timing: Are you operating lunch and dinner or extended hours requiring different hospitality approaches?
- Technology integration: Do you use reservation systems, waiting list management, or digital guest services?
- Physical environment: How many dining areas, levels, or sections require guest coordination?
- Market position: Are you competing on hospitality excellence, operational efficiency, or unique experiences?

**Example 1: Fine Dining Restaurant**

We operate an upscale fine dining restaurant serving 80 covers nightly with emphasis on sophisticated hospitality and elegant guest experiences. Our restaurant host manages exclusive guest relations including reservation coordination, VIP service, and creating memorable first impressions for discerning diners. The role demands professional presentation and ability to maintain fine dining standards whilst coordinating seamlessly with service team and ensuring exceptional guest satisfaction.

**Example 2: Neighbourhood Bistro**

We run a popular neighbourhood bistro serving 150 covers across lunch and dinner with focus on warm, welcoming hospitality for local families and casual diners. Our restaurant host creates friendly atmosphere through personal guest interaction, efficient seating coordination, and maintaining positive energy that makes both regulars and new guests feel at home. The environment requires genuine warmth and ability to handle diverse guest needs whilst supporting busy service operations.

**Example 3: Busy City Centre Restaurant**

We're a vibrant city centre restaurant serving 200 covers daily with diverse clientele including business diners, tourists, and social groups. Our restaurant host manages dynamic guest flow including walk-ins, reservations, and varying party sizes whilst maintaining efficient operations and positive guest experiences. The role requires excellent multitasking abilities and professional energy to coordinate complex guest services during varying service intensities.

## Step 2: Outline Key Responsibilities for the Restaurant Host

The restaurant host role encompasses guest relations, coordination duties, and atmosphere management, but the specific tasks vary significantly between restaurants. Focus on the actual hospitality duties your host performs daily, from guest interaction to service coordination and first impression management.

Avoid generic descriptions like "greet guests" and create detailed responsibilities that reflect your restaurant's specific guest service demands and hospitality standards.

**Your goal is to outline tasks that reflect your restaurant's actual hosting needs and guest experience requirements.**

Write 10–15 bullet points covering the host's responsibilities throughout service. Segment the role into three clear hospitality areas:

**1. Guest Relations and First Impressions**

These responsibilities focus on direct guest interaction and hospitality delivery:

Consider who handles what in guest relations:

- Who manages guest arrivals, welcome procedures, and first impression creation?
- How are guest preferences, special requirements, and hospitality coordination handled?
- What guest communication and relationship building is expected throughout service?

Common guest relations tasks include:

- Greeting guests warmly upon arrival including professional welcome, eye contact, and positive first impression creation
- Managing guest inquiries including menu questions, reservation information, and restaurant service explanations
- Coordinating guest preferences including seating requests, special occasions, and dietary requirement communication
- Handling guest feedback and concerns with professionalism whilst escalating complex issues to management appropriately
- Providing information about restaurant services including wait times, menu highlights, and special offerings
- Managing guest departures including farewell interactions, feedback collection, and invitation for return visits
- Coordinating special services including coat check assistance, taxi coordination, and guest amenity provision
- Building guest relationships including regular customer recognition and personalised service delivery

**2. Seating Coordination and Table Management**

The core responsibilities for reservation management and operational coordination:

Ask yourself what seating management your restaurant demands:

- How complex are your reservation systems and table allocation requirements?
- What level of coordination with service teams and kitchen is required?
- How do you handle waiting lists, table turnover, and capacity optimization?
- What special seating arrangements and coordination protocols are needed?

Essential seating coordination tasks include:

- Managing reservation system including booking confirmations, modification requests, and arrival coordination
- Coordinating table allocation including seating optimization, party size accommodation, and preference management
- Managing waiting lists including accurate time estimates, guest communication, and seating priority coordination
- Coordinating with service team on table readiness, guest requirements, and seating timing optimization
- Handling special seating requests including accessibility needs, celebration arrangements, and VIP coordination
- Managing table turnover including departure coordination, cleaning communication, and reseating efficiency
- Coordinating group reservations including large party seating, special arrangements, and service team preparation
- Maintaining seating records including guest preferences, special requirements, and service notes

**3. Operational Support and Team Coordination**

Tasks that support restaurant operations and service team coordination:

Consider your coordination and support requirements:

- What communication is needed between host station and service teams?
- How do you handle operational coordination, guest services, and atmosphere maintenance?
- What support duties help maintain smooth restaurant operations during service?

Operational coordination responsibilities include:

- Coordinating with service team on guest arrivals, special requirements, and table preparation needs
- Managing communication flow including guest information, service updates, and operational coordination
- Supporting operational efficiency including guest flow optimization, service timing, and capacity management
- Coordinating with management on guest issues, service challenges, and operational improvement feedback
- Maintaining host station organization including reservation systems, guest information, and operational supplies
- Managing guest services including phone inquiries, takeaway coordination, and information provision
- Supporting atmosphere maintenance including music coordination, lighting awareness, and ambiance management
- Handling operational tasks including opening and closing duties, cleaning coordination, and equipment management

**If you have a host but no documented duties, you can:**

- Shadow your current host: Observe their guest interaction, coordination approach, and team communication throughout an entire service.
- Document their hospitality style: Note specific techniques they use with different guest types, situations, and service challenges.
- Consult your restaurant manager: Understand expectations for guest experience, service standards, and operational contribution.
- Review guest feedback: Analyse how host performance impacts guest satisfaction during different service scenarios.

Key questions to ask your current host might be:

- How do you prioritise competing guest demands during busy arrival periods?
- What communication techniques work best with different guest personalities and service needs?
- How do you handle challenging guest situations whilst maintaining positive atmosphere?
- What systems do you use to track reservations, guest preferences, and service coordination?
- How do you coordinate with servers and management during complex service challenges?
- What approaches do you take to create positive first impressions and lasting guest relationships?
- How do you balance efficiency with personal attention during varying operational demands?
- What methods do you use to maintain organisation and guest service quality during busy periods?

**Tips if you're unsure**

To develop comprehensive responsibility lists:

- Ask existing service staff to describe what they need from host support during operations
- Use your guest feedback and service reviews to identify areas requiring host coordination
- Consider what breaks down when host service is absent or ineffective
- Think about seasonal variations or special events that affect host responsibilities
- Review guest complaints and compliments to understand host service impact

**Example for fine dining restaurant**

As our restaurant host, your responsibilities include:

- Creating sophisticated first impressions for discerning guests through professional welcome and elegant hospitality delivery

## Step 3: Specify Required Skills for the Restaurant Host

A restaurant host requires excellent communication skills, strong customer service abilities, and outstanding hospitality instincts. Focus on the specific capabilities your restaurant demands rather than generic service requirements.

Building on responsibilities, identify the skills essential for effective restaurant host performance. This ensures candidates can accurately assess their capability and development needs for your specific hospitality environment.

Focus on skills that match your restaurant's guest service demands and avoid generic lists. Each establishment requires different approaches based on guest demographics, service complexity, and hospitality expectations.

**Your goal is to create a list that separates essential hospitality skills from skills that enhance performance.**

**1. Review your task list**

Connect each responsibility with the skill needed to excel:

Example:

- If they greet guests → they need communication skills and professional presentation
- If they manage reservations → they need organisational abilities and attention to detail
- If they coordinate with teams → they need teamwork skills and operational awareness
- If they handle guest concerns → they need problem-solving abilities and diplomatic communication
- If they maintain atmosphere → they need emotional intelligence and hospitality instincts

**2. Divide your skills list**

- Essential Skills: Non-negotiable capabilities needed from day one
- Preferred Skills: Additional skills that enhance performance but can be developed

**Key Skill Areas for Restaurant Host Roles**

Consider these fundamental skill categories:

- Professional presentation and personal grooming standards
- Organisational skills and attention to detail
- Multitasking abilities and time management competency

Tailor this based on your restaurant's exact requirements and guest service complexity.

- Understanding of city centre hospitality including business dining expectations and urban guest service requirements

## Step 4: Determine Experience Requirements

The restaurant host role can accommodate various experience levels depending on your restaurant's complexity and training capabilities. Be clear about whether you're seeking experienced hospitality professionals or enthusiastic candidates ready to learn guest service excellence.

Defining experience requirements helps candidates understand the hospitality expectations and prevents mismatched applications. However, being too restrictive can eliminate capable candidates with transferable skills and genuine hospitality potential.

**Your goal is to specify the type of customer service experience necessary, focusing on relevant environments rather than just years served.**

**1. Identify if the role suits a new, experienced, or specialist host**

- New to hospitality: Someone with strong interpersonal skills ready to learn restaurant hosting with comprehensive training and support
- Experienced host: Requires proven restaurant or hospitality experience with guest relations and service coordination background
- Specialist host: Looking for hospitality professional with specific expertise in your market segment or service style

Be honest about your needs; a supportive restaurant shouldn't demand extensive experience if they can provide appropriate training and development.

**2. Specify the type of experience rather than just duration**

Instead of simply stating "6 months customer service experience," outline important service environments and capabilities:

- Do they need experience in restaurants, hospitality, or customer-facing service roles?
- Must they understand reservation systems, guest relations, or team coordination?
- Is experience with specific demographics like families, business diners, or special events beneficial?
- Do they need experience with multitasking, problem-solving, or high-pressure environments?

Be precise — someone with 12 months in retail customer service differs significantly from 6 months in restaurant hosting.

**3. Indicate whether training and development will be provided**

If you're willing to invest in hospitality development, highlight it clearly. Conversely, if you need someone ready to handle complex guest situations immediately, specify that expectation.

Consider what support you can realistically provide:

- Will you offer mentoring from experienced host staff or management?
- Do you have structured training programmes for reservation systems and guest service procedures?
- Can you provide shadowing periods with successful hosts in similar restaurants?
- What timeline do you expect for full competency and independent guest service delivery?

**Example for new hospitality candidate**

"We welcome candidates with strong interpersonal skills and genuine enthusiasm for creating positive guest experiences. You should demonstrate excellent communication abilities, professional presentation, and commitment to hospitality excellence. Restaurant hosting training will be provided including reservation systems, guest relations techniques, and service coordination. We seek candidates with positive attitude, customer focus, and dedication to developing hospitality skills."

**Example for experienced host**

"We seek candidates with minimum 8 months' restaurant host or equivalent guest service experience in hospitality environments. You should demonstrate proven ability to manage guest relations, coordinate reservations, and work effectively with service teams. Experience with hospitality procedures, guest service delivery, and team coordination is preferred. We provide ongoing support for skill development but expect immediate competency with core hosting duties."

**Example for specialist hosting role**

"Candidates should bring minimum 12 months' restaurant host experience in similar service styles or guest demographics. You must demonstrate exceptional guest relations abilities, advanced system competency, and track record of creating positive guest experiences. Experience with our specific guest requirements, service challenges, and hospitality complexity is essential for immediate contribution and service excellence."

**Example for fine dining host**

"We require candidates with customer service experience in upscale hospitality, fine dining, or luxury service environments. Previous experience with sophisticated guest relations, VIP service, and professional presentation is essential. Understanding of fine dining standards, luxury hospitality expectations, and elegant guest communication necessary. Minimum 6 months in similar hospitality capacity with professional service focus required."

## Step 5: Describe the Ideal Personality Fit

The restaurant host role demands specific personality traits for successful guest relations and service delivery. This position requires someone who can create positive first impressions whilst maintaining professional standards and supporting team coordination.

While technical skills matter, long-term success depends on cultural fit and hospitality personality. This section helps you attract candidates whose natural traits align with your restaurant's service philosophy and guest expectations.

Avoid generic phrases like "people person" or "outgoing personality" which don't convey meaningful information to potential candidates.

Instead, describe specific personality traits and behavioral characteristics that succeed in your hospitality environment.

**Your goal is to articulate the service style, professional presence, and interpersonal skills that thrive in your guest relations culture.**

**1. Reflect on your service culture and guest dynamics**

Consider the following:

- What personality traits do your most successful host staff demonstrate?
- What characteristics have struggled in previous host hires?
- Does your restaurant thrive with formal professionalism or warm, casual approaches?
- Are guest interactions sophisticated and elegant or friendly and approachable?
- What communication style works best with your typical guest demographic?
- Do you need someone energetic and proactive or calm and composed?
- How does your restaurant handle service pressure and challenging guest situations?
- What personality traits help during busy periods and complex guest interactions?

Develop keywords that capture the hospitality presence and approach desired.

**2. Be definitive, not general**

Avoid vague terms and instead illustrate traits in action:

- "Maintains warm professionalism during high-volume arrival periods whilst ensuring each guest feels personally welcomed and valued"
- "Demonstrates natural hospitality instincts when handling guest concerns and service coordination with grace and efficiency"
- "Adapts communication style to connect with diverse guest personalities whilst maintaining consistent service standards"
- "Shows genuine enthusiasm for creating memorable experiences that inspires guest loyalty and positive restaurant reputation"
- "Exhibits calm composure when managing multiple priorities whilst maintaining attention to detail and guest satisfaction focus"

**3. Align personality attributes with hospitality responsibilities**

- In fine dining or upscale environments: Look for sophisticated presence combined with attention to detail and refined communication
- In family or casual restaurants: Seek warmth and energy balanced with patience and adaptability for diverse guest needs
- In busy or high-volume settings: Value resilience and multitasking abilities balanced with positive energy and professional presentation

**Example for fine dining restaurant**

"You'll excel as our restaurant host if you possess natural elegance and sophisticated communication abilities combined with genuine passion for luxury hospitality excellence. We value team members who create memorable first impressions through refined presentation and gracious guest relations, ensuring fine dining standards whilst maintaining professional composure during sophisticated service delivery. The ability to handle VIP guests with discretion, maintain elegant atmosphere, and coordinate seamlessly with service teams whilst representing our fine dining reputation is essential."

**Example for neighbourhood bistro**

"This role suits someone with warm, authentic personality who genuinely enjoys building community relationships and creating welcoming experiences for local families and casual diners. We value host staff who balance friendly approachability with professional service delivery, ensuring guests feel at home whilst maintaining operational efficiency and positive atmosphere. Strong interpersonal skills, patience with diverse guest needs, and ability to maintain cheerful energy whilst handling neighbourhood hospitality and community engagement are crucial."

**Example for busy city centre restaurant**

"Our ideal restaurant host demonstrates dynamic energy and professional efficiency combined with positive attitude and excellent multitasking abilities appropriate for high-volume guest service. You should possess resilience and communication skills suitable for managing diverse clientele whilst maintaining consistent service standards that ensure guest satisfaction. Natural organisation abilities, grace under pressure, and ability to maintain welcoming atmosphere whilst coordinating complex guest services and operational demands are essential qualities."

**Tips if you're stuck**

- Consult current host team: "What personality qualities do guests most respond to positively?"
- Observe successful restaurant hosts during different service situations and guest interactions
- Consider what guest feedback reveals about preferred service and communication styles
- Ask your management team what personality traits create the most effective guest relations environment
- Reflect on previous host hires - what personalities succeeded or struggled with your guest demographic?
- Be authentic about your environment - if it's demanding and fast-paced, seek energetic and resilient candidates
- Consider cultural fit with your guest expectations and service positioning

## Step 6: Provide Transparency on Compensation

Transparency about compensation is crucial for attracting quality restaurant host candidates. This front-line hospitality role deserves clear information about pay structure and professional development opportunities.

This section often receives inadequate attention, yet it's fundamental to attracting committed hospitality professionals. Candidates need clarity on compensation and career advancement to make informed decisions about host opportunities.

While host roles may be entry-level positions, transparency about benefits, development opportunities, and working conditions demonstrates professionalism and builds trust with potential team members.

**Be clear about:**

- The hourly rate or salary structure
- Hospitality benefits and professional development opportunities  
- What distinguishes your restaurant as an exceptional place to work and develop

**1. Make compensation clear — hourly rate and benefits**

Specify the definite rate or present a realistic range. Guidance when unsure includes:

- Research similar restaurant host positions in your area using hospitality job boards and industry contacts
- Consider your expectations — are you seeking new, experienced, or specialist hospitality professionals?
- Factor in the complexity and responsibility level of your specific host role
- Include performance bonuses, tips, or additional compensation if applicable

Example:
£10.50–£12.50 per hour based on experience and performance
£11.00 starting rate with performance reviews and merit increases every 6 months
£21,000–£24,000 annually for full-time positions with benefits package

Avoiding terms like "competitive salary" is essential as they provide no useful information to candidates.

**2. Highlight hospitality benefits and opportunities**

Benefits beyond hourly rate can significantly attract quality candidates. Consider:

- Professional development funding for hospitality qualifications and customer service training
- Career advancement opportunities within restaurant operations and management pathways
- Performance bonuses, tip sharing, or guest satisfaction incentive programmes
- Healthcare benefits, staff meals, and personal development support
- Industry networking opportunities, training courses, and professional recognition
- Flexible scheduling, holiday entitlement, and work-life balance support
- Staff dining privileges, hospitality discounts, and team development activities

Example:
- Annual training budget of £600 for customer service and hospitality development
- Performance bonuses based on guest satisfaction scores and service excellence
- Staff meals during all shifts and restaurant dining discounts
- 22 days paid holiday plus bank holidays and personal development time
- Career development support with clear progression to senior host and supervisory roles
- Hospitality industry benefits and professional development opportunities

**3. Discuss career progression and development (if available)**

Communicate advancement opportunities and professional development support available.

Example:

Our host positions often advance to senior host, guest services coordination, or management roles, with dedicated support for those pursuing hospitality qualifications.
