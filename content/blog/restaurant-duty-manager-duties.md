 ## Step 1: Start with the Restaurant Environment and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 Start by describing the environment and atmosphere of your restaurant. This will set expectations for candidates about what working in your restaurant feels like and will help filter applicants that align with your values and operational pace.

 **Your goal is to quickly show the candidate:**

- What kind of establishment you run

- What type of service style you offer

- What the daily work environment is like

 Use this with the following structure:

 **1. What type of restaurant are you?**

 Label your establishment clearly: “We’re a high-end dining restaurant / a family-friendly bistro / a bustling pizzeria...”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Describe the service approach and guest interactions. For example:

- “We offer full table service with an extensive wine list and fine dining menu.”

- “Our establishment focuses on casual, quick service with a focus on local produce.”

- “We run a high-energy diner with a fun and lively atmosphere.”

 **3. What makes your restaurant a great workplace?**

 Highlight the qualities that set your team and restaurant apart. For example:

- “Our team is like a family, with everyone pitching in to create a memorable customer experience.”

- “We have a flexible, dynamic environment where creativity is encouraged.”

- “Our commitment to sustainability and local sourcing is central to our identity.”

 **Tips if you’re unsure about what to write:**

- Think about a typical shift – what’s the pace like?

- How many covers do you serve daily?

- What do staff enjoy most about working there?

- What service challenges are commonly faced?

- What are your customers’ favourite things about your place?

 ## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Restaurant Duty Manager

 Accurately defined responsibilities help attract candidates who align well with the job's actual requirements.

 **Your goal is to create a list that reflects your restaurant’s needs — not just generic managerial duties.**

 Write detailed bullet points that reflect what your duty manager will actually do on a daily basis in your business.

 Break the role into three sections:

 **1. Opening and prep responsibilities**

 Tasks that set the team up for a successful day.

- Ensure dining areas, kitchens, and bars are prepared and clean.

- Oversee staff briefings to communicate the day’s goals and specials.

 **2. Service responsibilities**

 Tasks carried out during hours of operation.

- Coordinate front of house and kitchen operations for smooth service.

- Handle customer inquiries and resolve complaints efficiently.

- Monitor order fulfilment, ensuring quality and speed.

- Manage staff rotas and breaks while maintaining service efficiency.

 **3. Closing responsibilities**

 Tasks required to effectively end shifts and prepare for the next day.

- Conduct final financial settlements and verify cash, card, and voucher transactions.

- Ensure all cleaning checklists are completed before closing.

- Review stock levels and place orders for next-day delivery.

 **If you don’t already have documented duties for your managers, you can:**

- Interview managers and ask them to outline their daily routines.

- Assess past performance reviews for insights on management tasks.

- Ask staff about support they need from a manager during shifts.

 ## Step 3: Define What Skills the Person Will Need to Have

 Establish clear skills that align with the role's responsibilities to help candidates gauge their suitability.

 **Your goal is to list must-have and desirable skills reflecting your restaurant's actual needs.**

 **1. Align skills with responsibilities**

- If they need to manage staff rotas → include staff scheduling and workforce management skills.

- If they handle customer complaints → include conflict resolution and dynamic problem-solving skills.

- If managing bar operations → list some understanding of beverage inventory management.

 **2. Divide into must-have skills and nice-to-have skills**

- **Must-have skills** - Essential skills the person needs on day one.

- **Nice-to-have skills** - Additional skills that could be developed over time.

 **Common skills to consider:**

- Leadership and team management

- Customer service excellence

- Effective communication with voice tone adaptation

- Time management and scheduling

- Knowledge of safety and hygiene regulations

- Adaptability in high-pressure situations

- Basic culinary or beverage knowledge (if relevant)

 **Example for a high-end restaurant**

 **Must-Have Skills**

- Proven leadership skills and experience managing teams.

- Exceptional customer service and complaint resolution abilities.

- Solid understanding of restaurant operations, including financial management.

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Knowledge of wine pairing and special diet menus.

- Experience organising special events and functions.

 ## Step 4: Defining How Much Experience Is Required

 Clarifying the required experience is key to attracting the right candidates and setting clear expectations for their role.

 **Your goal is to specify the type of experience needed — not just the number of years.**

 **1. Identify the role level: Trainee, experienced, or senior manager**

- **Entry-level:** Good for assistant managers looking to step up, training provided.

- **Mid-level:** Prior management experience in similar establishments required.

- **Senior:** Extensive background in high-pressure environments, option to lead projects.

 **2. Detail the type of experience rather than the time**

- Have they focused on guest experiences and quality assurance?

- Have they been responsible for a team in a busy restaurant setting?

- Have they worked under rigorous health and safety regulations?

 **3. Indicate opportunities for training and development**

 If applicable, mention any training that will be offered and if they’re expected to come with specific skills ready.

 ## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 Hiring the right personality helps ensure productive team dynamics and job satisfaction.

 **Your goal is to outline key character traits that are important in your workplace.**

 **1. Consider winning team qualities**

- What attitudes align with your current top performers?

- Do high-energy or more reserved manners thrive better in your establishment?

- How should they interact with guests – more formally or relaxed and friendly?

 **2. Be precise and relatable**

- Instead of saying “excellent communicator,” explain what dynamic and open communication looks like in your team.

- List examples like “approaches each service issue resourcefully.”

 **Example for a lively, busy environment**

 "You’ll feel at home here if you are adaptable, quick to respond to challenges, and thrive in a fast-paced yet supportive setting. We need leaders who communicate effectively, welcome continuous improvement, and maintain positive energy during peak times."

 **Example for a calm, elegant venue**

 "This position is ideal for someone who values meticulousness and excels in calm, thoughtful customer interaction. You’ll lead by example, inspiring a seamless experience that our guests and team appreciate. We value genuine hospitality and a steady voice amid diverse situations."

 ## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 Compensation transparency is crucial for both attracting talent and beginning trustworthy employer-employee relations.

 **Be clear with:**

- The exact salary or hourly rate

- Bonus structures or incentive plans

- Any additional benefits, perks, or development opportunities

 **1. Offer straightforward pay details**

- Include precise figures or a feasible range.

- Compare with comparable roles in your locale.

- If variable, based on experience, note it within a range.

 Example:

 £13.50-£15.00 per hour based on experiencePossible performance-based bonuses

 **2. Clearly outline benefits**

- Meals or discounts

- Flexible working patterns or guaranteed days off

- Opportunities for advancement

- Any scheduled team activities or additional classes available

 Example wage and benefits section:

- Salary: £28,000 - £32,000 per annum, plus service charge allocation

- 28 days of holiday (includes public holidays)

- Comprehensive training sessions and career development programmes

- Discounted meals during sessions and complimentary dining for two each month

- Flexible scheduling with several weekends off per month

 **Tips if you’re uncertain:**

- Consider what would encourage someone to remain in the role over time.

- Honestly outline any constraints but emphasise positives as well.

- If wages are on the lower side, highlight desirable job aspects, like a healthy work-life balance, supportive environment, training, or growth potential.
