 In the UK, the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 say employers must provide first aid equipment, facilities and people so employees can be given immediate help if they're injured or taken ill at work. The Regulations apply to all workplaces, including those with less than five employees.

 So it's important for hospitality businesses to assess first aid needs and have the right arrangements in place. This means looking at things like workplace hazards, the number of employees, and the type of work you do. The assessment will help you figure out what first aid equipment, facilities and trained people you need to manage the risks.

 You might also need to think about the public - for hotels or restaurants, it's a good idea to include them in your planning too.

 In the US, while there's no specific legislation on first aid at work, the OSHA Act requires employers to provide a safe workplace. This includes giving medical attention to any employees who get ill or injured. OSHA standards also say workplaces should have first aid supplies on hand.

 So for hospitality businesses in the US, it's still crucial to assess the risks and make sure you've got the right first aid measures in place. You'll need to look at the specific hazards in your workplace and make a plan to manage them.

 ## First Aid at Work Arrangements

 -  Ensure that there are enough first aid boxes for the number of employees on shift at any one time. Basic contents of a first aid box should include:   20 individually wrapped sterile plasters (assorted sizes), appropriate to the type of work (dressings should be of a detectable type for food handlers)   A leaflet giving general guidance on first aid (for example, HSE leaflet ‘Basic advice on first aid at work’)   Two sterile eye pads   Six safety pins   Two individually wrapped triangular bandages (sterile)   Six medium-sized individually wrapped sterile unmedicated wound dressings   Two large sterile individually wrapped unmedicated wound dressings   At least three pairs of disposable gloves   
-  20 individually wrapped sterile plasters (assorted sizes), appropriate to the type of work (dressings should be of a detectable type for food handlers) 
-  A leaflet giving general guidance on first aid (for example, HSE leaflet ‘Basic advice on first aid at work’) 
-  Two sterile eye pads 
-  Six safety pins 
-  Two individually wrapped triangular bandages (sterile) 
-  Six medium-sized individually wrapped sterile unmedicated wound dressings 
-  Two large sterile individually wrapped unmedicated wound dressings 
-  At least three pairs of disposable gloves 
-  Consider all hospitality services and ensure if preparing hot food or drinks, there is first aid provision for burns. 
-  Arrange for the first aid box contents to be checked to ensure suitable provision and contents are in date. 
-  Provide resources for the purchase of further contents to comply with Health &amp; Safety Executive recommended minimum contents for a standard occupational first aid box (as above). 
-  Review your first aid arrangements for suitability to the hospitality sector and employees who have advised of any specific medical condition which may require medication (e.g. Allergies – Using an Epi-Pen). This information should be made available to the first aiders to ensure they can respond in the appropriate manner. 
-  There is no legal requirement for your first aid provision to cater to members of the public; however, you should extend any assistance required in the event of an accident or emergency to facilitate a favourable outcome.

 ## ​First Aid Training&nbsp;Arrangements

 Ensure that first-aid training is given by persons or organisations qualified to do so.&nbsp;Guidance stipulates that low risk working environments like the hospitality sector, should aim to have one trained first aider to every 20 employees and ensure suitable cover for holidays &amp; sickness to guarantee this ratio during the working day. Training shall&nbsp;be made available to any members of the workforce expressing an interest, provided that there is a need for additional first aiders, in line with the guidance above.&nbsp;

 -  Responsible Persons&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify the amount of first aiders required for the business and to ensure that there are staff who are trained to the same level, so cover can be provided for holidays and sickness.&nbsp; 
-  Ensure that all staff&nbsp;who are&nbsp;trained as a first aider, are added to the business training matrix and ensure when training is up for renewal, staff are given time off to attend planned refresher training.&nbsp; 
-  Display names of first aid trained personnel or appointed persons in prominent positions throughout the premises&nbsp;and ensure all staff know where the first box is located.&nbsp; 
-  Routinely review&nbsp;the amount of first aid trained personnel to ensure compliance with stated guidance and to always ensure during operating hours that there is a suitable first aid provision.&nbsp; 
-  Arrange training for new first aiders in the event a recognised first aider leaves the business.&nbsp;
