title: How to properly manage food stock rotation and date labelling.

Stock rotation is critical to the supply of safe food but also important for the supply of food at its best quality. Effective ordering, storing food correctly and proper stock rotation will ensure that food is always safe to eat, of the best product quality as well as avoiding unnecessary wastage and stock loss.
Effective stock rotation can in many cases be managed by using the principle of FIFO method i.e. First in, first out (using older stock first). Especially where expiration date (and sell by date) is concerned. This stock loss mitigation can be managed through not holding excessive levels of stock, opening and closing checks and maintaining effective storage temperatures and procedures. ## How to use FIFO?

 Check all food being delivered to ensure use by dates and best before dates are acceptable, that it has been delivered at the correct temperatures, that the packaging is intact, that there is no possibility of cross contamination from raw to RTE foods or to check if allergenic contamination has occurred. Also checks for pest activity or pest damage to packaging.

 Ensure that staff who accept deliveries have been trained to know what would be deemed acceptable or not and that they fully understand delivery records.

 Correctly date label all foods that have been opened, decanted, unused, cooked or prepared, for freezing etc.

 Carry out daily inspections of fridges, freezers and dry stores to identify foods that are approaching expiry dates or out of date, ensure stock is rotated to ensure use before expiry dates.
