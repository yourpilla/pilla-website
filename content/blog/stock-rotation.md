 Stock rotation is critical to the supply of safe food but also important for the supply of food at its best quality. Effective ordering, storing food correctly and proper stock rotation will ensure that food is always safe to eat, of the best product quality as well as avoiding unnecessary wastage and stock loss.
Effective stock rotation can in many cases be managed by using the principle of FIFO method i.e. First in, first out (using older stock first). Especially where expiration date (and sell by date) is concerned. This stock loss mitigation can be managed through not holding excessive levels of stock, opening and closing checks and maintaining effective storage temperatures and procedures. ## How to use FIFO?

 Check all food being delivered to ensure use by dates and best before dates are acceptable, that it has been delivered at the correct temperatures, that the packaging is intact, that there is no possibility of cross contamination from raw to RTE foods or to check if allergenic contamination has occurred. Also checks for pest activity or pest damage to packaging.

 Ensure that staff who accept deliveries have been trained to know what would be deemed acceptable or not and that they fully understand delivery records.

 Correctly date label all foods that have been opened, decanted, unused, cooked or prepared, for freezing etc.

 Carry out daily inspections of fridges, freezers and dry stores to identify foods that are approaching expiry dates or out of date, ensure stock is rotated to ensure use before expiry dates.

 Dispose of out of date foods and record in the wastage log.

 Go through the menu regularly and plan stock you will need in advance, experience in this should avoid unnecessary wastage.

 When deliveries are received you must rotate old and new stock to ensure that food safety and quality is maintained.

 To do this, remove old stock first, replace the new stock in space of the old stock, then place old stock in front of or on top of newer stock ensuring it will be used first, make sure that fresh containers are used when needed to avoid cross contamination and food spoilage.

 Ensure robust control and management of items within the dry storage areas ensuring best before dates are not exceeded.

 Ensure items in refrigerated storage are controlled and managed vigilantly ensuring that use by dates are never exceeded, these items must be discarded immediately if safe usage date has passed.

 Ensure robust control and management of frozen items so that maximum quality and safety is maintained at all times.

 ## How to use date labelling of food products properly

 Do not cover any original labelling on a product with another label

 If a product is taken out of its original packaging, decanted or stored otherwise, consideration must be taken of its original use by date if this product is not thermally processed

 Only approved labels should be used that show, production date, use by dates and allergens contained therein

 Products that have been thermally processed (cooked/boiled etc.), if not to be used immediately, will now require a label showing a new use by date, this date should not exceed 3 days including the day of production. For example. A product produced on Monday must be used by the following Wednesday at the latest, otherwise this must be discarded and this waste recorded

 When prepared food is frozen, indicate the date of freezing, complete the use by date, which must not exceed one month from date of freezing, indicate any allergens contained therein

 When frozen food is defrosted it will have a maximum safe usability of 24 hours after defrosting (the defrosting process itself can take 12-24 hours) food taken out of frozen storage must be used within 2 days maximum. If not used this food must be discarded and this waste recorded

 Store all decanted foods in lidded containers

 Consider specific safe storage conditions for foods containing allergens to prevent cross contamination at all times

 Ensure all frozen items are stored appropriately and/or wrapped completely to prevent freezer burn, which can compromise the quality of the product

 ## Corrective actions

 - Freeze stock that will not be used before use by date, adjust stock levels accordingly in future
- If you have any reason to suspect that food has not been handled safely or not delivered at a safe temperature, reject the delivery or quarantine and contact supplier to remove
- Review your delivery acceptance procedure including increased supervision and retrain staff if necessary
- Carry out more frequent spot checks
