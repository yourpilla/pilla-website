  - Risk assessments for workplace violence are important in hospitality settings, especially for late-night operations.
- The assessment should be conducted by someone familiar with the venue and the team, such as a manager or security lead.
- You should carry out a violence at work risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is safe and protected. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built violence at work risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## Structuring Your Violence Risk Assessment

 Unlike general health and safety assessments, a violence risk assessment is specifically geared towards identifying and mitigating risks around aggressive and hostile behaviours in your venue. Given the unique nature of every venue and its operating hours, this assessment requires careful consideration of your specific circumstances and staff roles.

 In this guidance, I’ll cover how to:

 - Identify groups at risk of violence or aggression
- Evaluate current controls and their effectiveness
- Plan for necessary improvements or additional controls
- Ensure consistent staff training and communication around safety

 By the end, you'll have a clear framework to follow or adapt within your Pilla template.

 ## 1. Night Working (11pm – 6am)

 ## Who may be harmed by having to work between 11pm – 6am?

 List the job roles that work night shifts as part of their duties. This includes staff who regularly work these hours, such as bar staff, night managers, and security personnel.

 ## What are you already doing to control the risks?

 Your current practices might include:

 - Annual health questionnaires to monitor staff well-being
- Encouraging staff to report any health or safety concerns
- Managing rotas to ensure adequate rest between shifts
- Ensuring sufficient, trained staff are available during night shifts
- Regular safeguarding check-ins to address any issues promptly
- Monitoring working hours to ensure legal compliance

 ## What further actions do you need to take?

 These might include:

 - Providing training on rest and recovery to help staff manage fatigue
- Encouraging regular safeguarding meetings for continuous support
- Continuing to monitor hours worked to prevent health risks
- Promoting a culture that encourages health reporting among staff

 ## 2. Noise Exposure

 ## Who may be harmed by risks associated with noise?

 Identify job roles or third parties (e.g. contractors, customers) that may be exposed to excessive noise. This could include bar staff, kitchen staff, and maintenance personnel who frequently work in noisy areas.

 ## What are you already doing to control the risks?

 Your current measures could include:

 - Banning personal stereos to prevent unnecessary noise
- Using directional speakers to control noise levels
- Installing low-noise equipment to reduce overall noise pollution
- Providing staff training on noise awareness
- Implementing noise limiters on audio equipment
- Designating 'quiet zones' for staff relaxation
- Rotating staff to minimise exposure duration
- Providing ear protection for high-noise settings

 ## What further actions do you need to take?

 Consider actions such as:

 - Implementing a regular noise monitoring schedule
- Providing hearing protection equipment where necessary
- Arranging hearing tests if occupational noise levels exceed action thresholds

 ## 3. Cash Handling and Venue Security

 ## Who may be harmed by risks associated with security and cash handling?

 This typically includes bar and reception staff, as well as other FOH roles that handle cash transactions or oversee venue security.

 ## What are you already doing to control the risks?

 Your existing measures might involve:

 - Encouraging cashless transactions to minimise cash on premises
- Avoiding predictable banking routines to deter theft
- Ensuring balanced staff levels, especially during peak times
- Utilizing locks, alarms, and CCTV for physical security
- Minimizing lone working conditions when handling cash
- Briefing staff on robbery or emergency procedures
- Displaying emergency contacts visibly for quick access

 ## What further actions do you need to take?

 Actions to consider include:

 - Continuing to review and improve security arrangements regularly
- Clearly communicating with staff about protocols during incidents

 ## 4. Violence Towards Staff and Public

 ## Who may be harmed by risks associated with violence?

 Include all staff and customers, particularly in late-night settings where exposure to aggressive or violent behavior is more likely.

 ## What are you already doing to control the risks?

 - Providing conflict de-escalation training for staff
- Employing SIA-licensed security personnel
- Ensuring first aid kits are accessible and equipped
- Implementing queue management and entry procedures
- Using CCTV and radios for communication and monitoring
- Preventing overcrowding and managing capacity limits
- Setting clear alcohol service limits to prevent intoxication
- Utilizing glass collectors to minimize hazards

 ## What further actions do you need to take?

 - Expand information sharing with local venues about known risks and incidents
- Regularly review and update violence prevention training and staff awareness initiatives

 ## 5. Lone Working — Locking Up After Hours

 ## What arrangements are in place to ensure staff locking up after hours do so safely and arrive home safely?

 - Consider implementing check-in systems to confirm safe departure
- Use WhatsApp or similar messaging systems for status updates
- Have emergency contacts readily available
- Establish procedures for following up if someone fails to check in
