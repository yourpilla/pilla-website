  - You must carry out risk assessments on equipment with significant risk to comply with The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER as amended 2002) in the UK. Examples of high risk equipment would be a meat slicer, dishwasher and vacuum packers.
- You should carry out a separate risk assessment for every piece of equipment that poses a high risk.&nbsp;
- Pilla has a pre-built equipment risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. What is the name of the equipment or work equipment you are assessing?

 This section is about identifying exactly which piece of equipment you're assessing. This ensures that the risk assessment is traceable, specific, and easy to update later.

 You should include:

 - Equipment name (e.g. “Hobart HCM450 Cutter Mixer”)
- Model and serial number if visible
- Location (e.g. “Prep Room – Left Counter”)
- Whether you own, rent, or lease it

 Why it matters: Different models have different hazards. A 60-litre combi oven carries different risks to a single-deck domestic-style oven. You need to be specific so that training, inspections, and controls are relevant and appropriate.

 **What good answers look like:**

 You don’t need long descriptions — just the critical info:

 "Rational iCombi Classic 6-1/1 Combi Oven Serial No: RCL6109387 Supplied and installed by [Equipment Co] in July 2023 Located in Main Kitchen, fixed to floor bracket Owned outright by the business"

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Physically check the item. Look for a rating plate (usually on the back, side, or underneath).
- Take a photo of the serial plate and attach it to your record.
- Confirm whether it’s leased or owned — this helps clarify who’s responsible for servicing and inspections.
- Record where it is in your kitchen — especially if you have duplicates (e.g. “Combi Oven 1, Right-Hand Side”).

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Oven” – Too vague. You may have multiple ovens — which one are you assessing?
- “Combi oven in kitchen” – Better, but still missing key identifiers. You need model + location at minimum.
- Missing serial numbers – It makes follow-up servicing and compliance checks harder. Always include it if visible.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Attach a photo of the nameplate to the risk assessment file.
- Label the machine physically if you have more than one (e.g. “Vac Pack A”).
- Store a copy of any user manuals or compliance certificates in your H&amp;S folder.

 ## 2. Who out of your workforce will use the equipment, and how could they be harmed?

 This section is about identifying the specific job roles in your team who use the equipment — and explaining how they might be harmed during normal use, cleaning, or maintenance. You’re not listing individuals here, but roles (e.g. chef, kitchen porter, maintenance staff).

 **Understanding who uses the equipment helps you figure out:**

 - Who is exposed to the risks
- Who needs training, supervision, and PPE
- Who must be included in your control measures

 You also need to think about how these people could realistically get hurt. This could include cuts, burns, electric shock, entanglement in moving parts, or exposure to chemicals.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under health and safety law, only trained, competent people should use work equipment. If you haven’t clearly identified who those people are, it becomes harder to:

 - Deliver the right training
- Prevent unauthorised or unsafe use
- Investigate properly if something goes wrong

 This section also helps you spot gaps in how you manage risk. For example, are people using equipment without proper authorisation? Are supervisors stepping in during busy periods without training? Are cleaning staff exposed to different risks than kitchen staff?

 **What good answers look like:**

 The equipment is used by:

 - Kitchen Porters — during cleaning at the end of each shift
- Chefs and Sous Chefs — during daily food prep
- Maintenance Technician — for monthly checks and repairs

 Risks include:

 - Contact with sharp blades during cleaning (Kitchen Porters)
- Burns from hot surfaces (Chefs)
- Electric shock or cuts during repairs (Maintenance Technician)

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Who uses this equipment as part of their normal duties?
- Are there other roles who might use it occasionally or in emergencies?
- What could go wrong during setup, use, cleaning, or maintenance?
- Have you had any incidents before, or near misses?
- Is anyone at risk who shouldn’t be using the equipment at all?

 Be honest — if people are using equipment who shouldn’t be, this is your chance to fix that with better controls or clearer rules.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Everyone uses it” — This is almost never true. Be specific about who does and doesn’t use the equipment.
- “Just the chefs” — What about cleaning or maintenance staff? If they touch or clean the equipment, they’re exposed to risks too.
- “It’s always been that way” — Don’t rely on old habits. Check that the right people are still the ones using the equipment safely and legally.
- “Only one person uses it” — If that person leaves or is off sick, will someone else step in without training?

 **Best practices:**

 - Use job titles, not individual names
- Include both frequent and occasional users
- Clearly state who is not allowed to use the equipment
- Identify how each group could be harmed
- Use this list to guide your training and supervision plan

 This section helps you take control of who’s using your equipment — and how you’re keeping them safe while they do it.

 ## 3. Who else besides users could be harmed by the equipment, and how?

 Not everyone who could be hurt by a piece of equipment will be the person operating it. This section is about identifying indirect risks — people who don’t use the equipment themselves, but could still be harmed by it through proximity, noise, spills, moving parts, or unexpected malfunctions.

 **These people might include:**

 - Waiting staff walking past
- Cleaners working nearby
- Delivery drivers in prep areas
- Front-of-house team on cross-over shifts
- Customers (if equipment is near service areas or visible in open kitchens)
- Contractors or engineers not familiar with your setup

 **Why it matters:**

 Health and safety laws don’t just protect equipment users — they protect everyone affected by work activities. That includes staff, visitors, and the public. If you overlook these people in your risk assessment, you might miss serious hazards.

 For example:

 - A slicer left running could catch the sleeve of someone leaning past
- Hot surfaces on an oven could burn someone walking by in a tight space
- A faulty wire could expose nearby workers to electrocution risks
- Cleaning chemicals used on equipment could splash onto someone nearby
- Steam from a dishwasher or coffee machine could scald passersby

 **What good answers look like:**

 Other people at risk:

 - Waiting staff: risk of burns if reaching over or past hot equipment in confined areas
- Cleaners: risk of contact with blades or electrical components during deep cleans
- Customers: risk of touching hot surfaces in open kitchen layout (e.g. counter-top pizza ovens)
- Maintenance contractors: risk of electric shock if equipment hasn’t been isolated correctly

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Could anyone near the equipment be harmed, even if they’re not using it?
- Are there tight spaces where staff move past the equipment frequently?
- Are the controls or hazards easily visible — or easy to miss?
- Could someone trip on a trailing wire or spill caused by the equipment?
- Do contractors or new starters know how to behave around it?
- Could customers or the public get too close?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It’s only dangerous if you’re using it” – Not true. A boiling kettle is dangerous to anyone who knocks it over.
- “The team knows to stay away” – Verbal warnings aren’t enough. You need physical barriers, signs, or procedures.
- “It’s tucked away in the back” – That doesn’t remove the need for assessment. Think about deep cleans, inspections, or busy periods where more people are around.

 **Best practices:**

 - Walk the area around the equipment and look at it from a non-user’s perspective
- Include delivery, cleaning, and maintenance tasks in your risk review
- Use signage, barriers, or zoning to reduce unnecessary access
- Include these people in your staff briefings if their roles put them near the risk
- Make this section part of your training and review discussions

 ## 4. How was the equipment selected and deemed suitable for your working environment?

 This section asks how you chose the equipment and whether it’s appropriate for the space, workload, and safety requirements of your venue.

 Why it matters: Under PUWER, employers must ensure that all equipment provided is “suitable” for the task and the working environment. Using domestic kit in a commercial kitchen? You might be non-compliant — and unsafe.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The machine was purchased from [Catering Co] in 2022 and recommended by our kitchen designer for our production volume (up to 200 covers/day). It is CE marked and complies with UKCA requirements. The model includes a steam vent and drip tray to reduce spill risk in our confined kitchen space. The purchase was approved by the Head Chef and General Manager. "

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Check where you bought or leased the item — was it a specialist supplier?
- Confirm whether it’s commercial-grade and CE/UKCA marked.
- Was it reviewed by anyone technical (e.g. your roaster, consultant, or head chef)?
- If it came with the building — has it been assessed and signed off?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It came with the site” – You still need to check it’s suitable and compliant.
- “We just picked it because it was cheap” – Cost should never trump safety and suitability.
- “Not sure if it’s CE or UKCA marked” – You must check — especially post-Brexit in the UK.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Always buy commercial equipment from reputable suppliers.
- Request compliance certificates (CE/UKCA) with your purchase.
- If unsure about suitability, get confirmation from your supplier in writing.

 ## 5. What arrangements are in place for the service and maintenance of the equipment?

 This section asks how you make sure the equipment stays in safe working condition — and what you do if something goes wrong. Servicing and maintenance are legal requirements under PUWER. You also need to be able to prove that you’ve taken reasonable steps to keep equipment in good repair.

 **What to include:**

 - Who carries out servicing (in-house, supplier, engineer)
- How often it’s done (e.g. monthly, quarterly, annually)
- What’s included (cleaning, descaling, part replacement)
- What happens if it breaks (e.g. fault reporting, isolation)
- How records are kept (paper log, digital tracker, engineer’s reports)

 **Why it matters:**

 Regular servicing isn’t just about performance — it’s about preventing injuries from faulty parts, electrical hazards, pressure build-up, or unexpected breakdowns. If a team member is hurt because a machine wasn’t maintained, you may be liable.

 **Example of a thorough answer:**

 "The slicer is cleaned daily by kitchen staff and deep cleaned weekly by the Sous Chef. Servicing is carried out twice a year by [Catering Equipment Services Ltd] following the manufacturer’s maintenance guide. We check the blade guard weekly and replace it if damaged. If a fault is found, the machine is unplugged and labelled “Out of Order – Do Not Use” until fixed. All service logs and invoices are stored in our digital equipment folder."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Ask: Who maintains this equipment, and how do they know what to do?
- Review the manual — does it specify how often to service or inspect the machine?
- Is there a process for isolating and labelling faulty equipment?
- Where do you keep your maintenance records? Could you show an inspector?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We clean it every day so that’s enough” – Cleaning is not the same as servicing.
- “We only fix it when something breaks” – That’s reactive, not preventive. It’s also non-compliant.
- “The engineer handles everything” – You’re still responsible for knowing what’s done, when, and keeping records.
- “No records kept” – Without proof, you can’t show compliance during inspections or if something goes wrong.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Set up regular servicing based on the manufacturer’s recommendation
- Log all maintenance activities (even in-house ones)
- Train staff on how to isolate faulty machines safely
- Use “Do Not Use” labels or signs for broken items
- Store service logs and certificates where you can access them easily

 ## 6. What is the use of equipment and what are the risks associated with use?

 This is where you identify the specific hazards linked to the equipment. What could go wrong when it’s used — and how might someone get hurt?

 **Why it matters:**

 Each piece of equipment carries different risks depending on how it’s powered, what it does, and how it’s used. You need to think about physical injuries (cuts, burns, shocks), exposure to substances (cleaning chemicals), and even ergonomic issues (lifting, repetition).

 **Examples of common risks:**

 - Burns or scalds – ovens, toasters, grills
- Cuts and amputations – slicers, mixers, mandolines
- Electric shock – faulty plugs, exposed cables
- Musculoskeletal injuries – repetitive prep tasks or lifting large items
- Explosion or rupture – pressurised or steam-based equipment

 **Example answer:**

 "Risks associated with the commercial food processor include: – Cuts to fingers during blade changes or cleaning – Electric shock from faulty plug or exposed cable – Entanglement hazard from staff wearing loose sleeves – Strain injuries from lifting the base unit (20kg) off storage shelf – Risk of slipping on spills from overfilled bowl"

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - What are the sharp, hot, or moving parts?
- What could happen if the machine is misused?
- Has anything gone wrong with it before? (Even close calls)
- Would new or inexperienced staff know what to avoid?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “No risks” – If there are genuinely no risks, you probably don’t need a risk assessment.
- Generic answers like “dangerous if used incorrectly” – That doesn’t help you put specific controls in place.
- Missing ergonomic risks – Lifting, bending, and repetitive use are often overlooked but cause real injury.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Be honest about the risks — even if they seem minor
- Use this section to guide your training, signage, and SOPs
- Break risks into categories: cuts, burns, shocks, pressure, strain

 ## 7. Describe how the controls to use the equipment safely and easily

 This section looks at the physical controls — switches, levers, dials, buttons — and whether they are designed for safe, easy, and intuitive use during service.

 **Why it matters:**

 In a fast-paced hospitality environment, poor control design can lead to real harm. Staff shouldn’t need to guess which button does what or struggle to turn off a machine in a hurry.

 **What to include:**

 - Are controls clearly marked?
- Are they placed in logical, accessible positions?
- Do they have safety features — e.g. spring-loaded levers, auto shutoff?
- Is there an emergency stop?

 **Example answer:**

 "The machine has a dial control panel with a clear on/off switch and labelled speed settings. The slicer blade only spins when the safety lid is locked in place. A spring-loaded stop switch automatically returns to zero when released. Emergency stop button is located beside the plug point. Controls are checked weekly by the Head Chef and reviewed during staff onboarding."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Stand at the machine — is it obvious how to operate it?
- Are all the buttons/dials labelled and in good condition?
- If there’s an emergency, can staff quickly stop the machine?
- Is anyone using workarounds (e.g. taping down a stuck switch)?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Worn-off labels or icons – Staff can’t operate controls safely if they can’t read them.
- No emergency stop – For machines with moving or hot parts, that’s a legal concern.
- Sticky or stiff buttons – That’s not just annoying — it’s a hazard.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Test all controls weekly as part of a quick visual check
- Include a controls overview in your training and SOPs
- Label all controls clearly and replace worn labels promptly

 ## 8. How is the equipment isolated from sources of power?

 This section explains how your equipment is completely and safely shut down from all its energy sources — whether that’s electricity, gas, steam, compressed air, or water. Proper isolation is essential for maintenance, cleaning, and emergency response.

 It’s not enough to “turn it off.” True isolation means cutting off the energy flow completely to prevent accidental startup or ongoing risk.

 **What you need to record:**

 - What types of power the equipment uses (e.g. electricity, gas, water, steam)
- How the equipment is isolated (plug, fused spur, isolation switch, valve, stopcock)
- Where the isolation points are located
- Who is authorised to isolate it
- Whether isolation is part of your daily, weekly or fault-handling routines

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER, you must ensure that work equipment can be safely and completely isolated from all energy sources. If a fault develops, or someone is carrying out cleaning or repairs, failure to isolate the equipment could result in:

 - Electric shock
- Burns or scalds from residual heat or pressure
- Unexpected start-up causing injury

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The equipment runs on mains electricity and is connected via a wall-mounted fused spur, labelled "Griddle Power". There is a secondary isolation switch located in the staff-only storeroom (fuse board panel). In the event of a fault, the equipment is switched off at the spur and labelled with a laminated “Out of Order – Do Not Use” sign. Only the Duty Manager or Maintenance Technician is authorised to isolate this equipment. Isolation points are tested quarterly and included in our emergency procedures training."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Does the equipment have a dedicated switch or plug, or does it share a power supply?
- Can you isolate it quickly and safely without tools?
- Is the isolation point labelled and easily accessible?
- Do staff know how to isolate it in an emergency?
- If you use gas or water, do you have shut-off valves? Are they tested regularly?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - “It turns off at the control panel” – That’s not isolation. Residual energy can still flow.
- “The plug is behind a fixed counter” – Isolation must be accessible and safe, not hidden or obstructed.
- “Only the engineer knows how to shut it off” – That’s not acceptable. At least one staff member on-site must know how.
- No signage on switches – Staff may hesitate or isolate the wrong item under pressure.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Label isolation switches clearly and keep them unobstructed
- Include isolation steps in your SOPs and cleaning/maintenance procedures
- Train all relevant staff on how and when to isolate equipment
- Use “Do Not Use” signs and physical lockouts where needed
- Test isolation points during regular equipment checks

 ## 9. How is the equipment housed so it is stable?

 This section checks whether your equipment is physically stable and secure in its working location — so it can’t fall, tip, shift, or collapse during use or cleaning.

 It applies to everything from countertop appliances (blenders, slicers) to heavy-duty floor-standing equipment (ovens, dishwashers, tilting kettles). If it can move, it needs to be checked.

 **What you need to record:**

 - What the equipment sits on (e.g. fixed bench, trolley, stainless steel counter)
- Whether it’s bolted, clamped, or otherwise secured
- Whether the surface is level and capable of bearing the load
- If movement checks are carried out (when cleaning, restocking, or moving equipment)

 **Why it matters:**

 Unstable equipment can lead to:

 - Hot liquid spills
- Equipment tipping or falling
- Disconnected power, gas or water lines
- Injuries from staff trying to stabilise or catch falling machines

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The salamander grill is mounted on a fixed stainless steel bench that is bolted to the wall and floor. Rubber anti-slip pads are installed beneath each foot. The unit weighs 35kg and remains stationary during use. Stability is checked weekly by the Kitchen Manager as part of deep cleaning routines. The bench is rated to hold up to 80kg and was professionally installed in May 2023."&nbsp;

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Can the equipment be knocked, bumped or slid out of position?
- Is the surface flat, level and strong enough?
- If the machine vibrates, does it slowly move over time?
- Have you ever seen staff trying to adjust or stabilise it during service?
- If it’s on wheels, are brakes used and do they work?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It just sits on a standard wooden counter” – That’s often not strong or stable enough for heavy equipment.
- “It wobbles slightly but hasn’t fallen yet” – Even minor instability can increase wear, risk, and downtime.
- “We put it on a trolley so we can clean behind it” – Then it must have locking wheels and a secure design to prevent movement during use.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Mount or bolt heavy equipment where possible
- Use counters with non-slip pads or feet for countertop items
- Check for movement regularly — not just when installing
- Avoid placing heavy equipment near edges or walkways
- Document stability in your cleaning or equipment checklists

 ## 10. Is the lighting where the equipment is used suitable and sufficient?

 This section focuses on visibility — whether the lighting around the equipment is good enough for staff to operate, clean, inspect and service it safely.

 Lighting should make hazards obvious, help staff read labels or displays, and support safe cleaning. It needs to be sufficient at all times of day — not just when it’s sunny.

 **What you need to record:**

 - The type of lighting (e.g. overhead LED, task lighting, ambient light)
- Where the lights are positioned in relation to the equipment
- Whether any shadows, glare, or flickering lights affect safe use
- How often bulbs are checked or replaced

 **Why it matters:**

 Poor lighting leads to mistakes — burns from unseen steam, injuries during cleaning, electrical faults being missed, or safety signage being ignored.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The equipment is located beneath an overhead 600-lumen LED panel. Additional task lighting is installed beneath the wall-mounted shelf above the prep table. This provides full visibility of the control panel, blade assembly, and surrounding work surface. Lighting is checked weekly as part of our facilities inspection and replaced by the maintenance team as required. No flicker or shadowing is present. Safety signage is clearly visible under current lighting levels."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Stand at the equipment — can you clearly see every surface, label, and control?
- Are there shadows cast by shelving or overhead fixtures?
- Can you see just as well during early mornings or winter nights?
- Do cleaning or maintenance tasks require better light?
- When a bulb goes out, is there a process to replace it?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It’s bright enough during the day” – Lighting must be adequate during all operating hours.
- “We use torches if needed” – That means your fixed lighting is inadequate.
- “There’s a light, but it flickers or has a shadow” – Replace bulbs and reposition lighting as needed to ensure consistency.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Install overhead lighting directly above equipment
- Add task lighting for prep benches, slicers, or anything with controls
- Check lighting levels in your monthly or weekly facilities inspection
- Make sure signage and labels are readable in the current light
- Replace bulbs proactively — don’t wait for total failure

 ## 11. Describe any markings or warning signage displayed on the equipment

 This section covers visual warnings — the stickers, signs, or labels that alert your team to specific hazards and safe practices when using the equipment.

 It includes factory-fitted warnings (like “Hot Surface” or “Electrical Hazard”) as well as local signs you’ve added (like “Wear Gloves When Cleaning” or “Out of Order”).

 What you need to record:

 - Any built-in manufacturer warnings (usually yellow/black stickers)
- Additional local signage you’ve added based on your risk assessment
- Where the signage is located and whether it’s visible during use
- Whether signage is reviewed and replaced if faded or damaged

 **Why it matters:**

 Signage is often the first line of defence — especially for new, temporary, or less experienced staff. Clear, visible warnings support good decision-making and safe behaviour.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The vacuum packer has manufacturer labels for “Electrical Hazard” and “Hot Surface” near the control panel and rear casing. We have added a laminated sign above the unit instructing staff to wear gloves and goggles when cleaning. A “Do Not Use If Lights Are Flashing” sign is displayed next to the indicator panel. All signage is reviewed monthly by the Duty Manager and replaced if damaged. Multilingual pictogram stickers are used to support staff with English as a second language."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - What warnings are built into the machine? Are they still readable?
- Do you need to add extra signage to address site-specific risks?
- Are there any cleaning, PPE, or emergency signs you could add?
- Could someone unfamiliar with the machine understand how to stay safe?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It had warnings when we bought it” – If they’re faded or missing now, they’re no longer valid.
- “We told staff what to do” – Visual signage reinforces training and protects new or cover staff.
- “We have lots of signs” – Too many signs can cause clutter. Prioritise clarity and relevance.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Use clear pictograms where possible (for burns, electric shock, PPE)
- Mount signs near controls, contact points, or danger zones
- Use laminated or weather-resistant materials in steamy or high-cleaning areas
- Review signage quarterly and after any layout or procedure change
- Add local signage where your assessment identifies gaps (e.g. descaling warnings, handwashing reminders)

 ## 12. Does the equipment require guarding?

 This section focuses on whether your equipment includes moving parts that could cause injury — and if so, whether those parts are adequately guarded to prevent contact or entanglement.

 Guarding applies to anything with blades, belts, fans, gears, or rotating components — from food processors to mixers, conveyor belts, or slicers. Some guarding is built into modern equipment; others require you to fit or manage it locally.

 **What you need to record:**

 - Whether the equipment has any hazardous moving parts
- What guards are fitted (e.g. interlocks, shields, safety covers)
- Whether the machine will operate without the guard in place (interlock status)
- Who checks the guards and how often

 **Why it matters:**

 Under PUWER, you must prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery. That means fitting fixed guards, interlocked guards, or adjustable shields where required.

 Lack of guarding is a serious legal breach and one of the most common causes of major injury in kitchens and prep areas.

 **What good answers look like:**

 &nbsp;The equipment has internal rotating blades and a top-loading chute. It is fitted with an interlocked safety lid that prevents operation unless locked in place. A clear polycarbonate guard covers the blade housing and is inspected weekly for cracks or warping. Staff are trained never to override the interlock or remove the guard. Any issues are logged and the machine is taken out of service if a guard is missing or damaged.&nbsp;

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Does the machine have any moving parts that could cause injury?
- Are those parts exposed during use, cleaning, or maintenance?
- Does the equipment have a guard or cover? Is it fixed or removable?
- Can the equipment operate with the guard removed (i.e. no interlock)?
- Are staff tempted to remove the guard for convenience or speed?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “It has a lid” – That’s not enough unless it prevents operation when removed.
- “The guard is a bit loose” – Any broken, warped or unstable guard must be repaired or replaced immediately.
- “We’ve never had an issue with it” – Lack of incidents isn’t proof of compliance.
- “We took the guard off because it was getting in the way” – That’s an instant red flag. Refit or replace the guard.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Only use equipment with interlocked guards if blades or moving parts are accessible
- Check guards as part of daily or weekly equipment inspections
- Train staff to never bypass or remove guards
- Take equipment out of service if the guard is loose, missing, or damaged
- Log guard inspections and repairs in your maintenance records

 ## 13. Is Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used as part of the safe system of work?

 This section checks whether any risks remain after all other controls are in place — and if so, whether suitable PPE is provided and used correctly.

 PPE is always a last resort, but still vital when risks can’t be completely eliminated. For example, cleaning chemicals, sharp surfaces, or heat exposure may still justify gloves, aprons, or goggles.

 **What you need to record:**

 - What types of PPE are required (gloves, aprons, goggles, masks, etc.)
- When PPE must be used (e.g. during cleaning, handling hot trays, blade change)
- Who provides it and where it is stored
- How staff are trained to use and replace PPE

 **Why it matters:**

 Under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, employers must provide suitable PPE where residual risks remain — and ensure it’s worn, maintained, and replaced when necessary.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "Staff wear cut-resistant gloves when cleaning or maintaining the meat slicer. Single-use nitrile gloves and protective goggles are worn during chemical cleaning. Heat-resistant mitts are provided for use with high-temperature equipment. All PPE is stored in a clearly labelled cabinet beside the prep sink. Training on correct use and replacement of PPE is included in all equipment inductions and refresher training."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Are there any tasks that expose staff to sharp edges, hot surfaces, chemicals, or splashes?
- What PPE have you provided — and is it suitable for those risks?
- Do staff know when and how to wear it?
- Is PPE available where it’s needed (not buried in a back office)?
- Do you check the condition and stock levels regularly?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We have gloves somewhere” – PPE must be available, accessible, and fit for purpose.
- “Staff wear gloves when they remember” – PPE use must be trained, expected, and enforced — not optional.
- “We use washing-up gloves for everything” – Use the right PPE for the task (e.g. chemical-resistant gloves for cleaning).

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Specify PPE use in your SOPs (e.g. “Wear gloves and goggles when descaling”)
- Keep PPE stored where the task takes place
- Train staff on correct use and replacement frequency
- Check and replace PPE regularly
- Log PPE requirements and usage as part of your risk assessment

 ## 14. What Information, Instruction, and Training was delivered?

 This section explains what staff were taught — and how you ensure they know how to use the equipment safely. It’s not enough to show someone once and hope for the best. PUWER requires that staff are trained and competent.

 **What you need to record:**

 - Who received the training (by job role)
- What was included (startup, shutdown, safe use, cleaning, isolation, PPE)
- How the training was delivered (in-house, external, supplier demo)
- How it was recorded (onboarding checklist, signed form, digital file)

 **Why it matters:**

 In the event of an incident, training records are the first thing a regulator or insurer will ask for. If you can’t prove staff were trained, you could be found liable — even if the person misused the equipment.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "All kitchen staff receive equipment-specific training as part of their first-week onboarding. This includes safe use, PPE requirements, emergency stop procedures, and cleaning protocols. Training is delivered by the Head Chef using our in-house SOP and checklist. Each training session is signed off by both trainer and trainee, and stored in their personnel file. Refresher training is delivered annually and when equipment is replaced or upgraded."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Have staff been formally shown how to use the equipment?
- Was the training consistent and repeatable?
- Was it recorded? Where?
- Do you provide refreshers or just train once?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We just show them on the first day” – Not enough. Structure it, record it, and sign it off.
- “Everyone already knows how to use it” – Don’t assume knowledge. You’re still responsible for competence.
- “We don’t write anything down” – Then you have no proof if something goes wrong.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Create a training checklist for each piece of equipment
- Store training records in a shared folder or digital file
- Include refresher training every 6–12 months
- Train on safe use, faults, shutdown, PPE, and cleaning

 ## 15. How is supervision organised to ensure the equipment is being used safely?

 This section explains how you monitor daily use of the equipment — to make sure that staff are following procedures, using the machine safely, and reporting problems.

 Even with the best training and controls, people make mistakes or cut corners. Supervision helps you catch problems early before they lead to harm.

 **What you need to record:**

 - Who is responsible for checking safe use (e.g. Head Chef, Supervisor)
- How frequently checks are done (daily, weekly, during service)
- What actions are taken if unsafe use is spotted (e.g. retraining, removal from duty)
- Whether logs or checklists are used to track this

 **Why it matters:**

 Supervision is a legal duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It shows you’re taking reasonable steps to keep people safe in real time — not just ticking boxes in paperwork.

 **What good answers look like:**

 "The Head Chef observes equipment use during daily prep and lunch service. Any unsafe behaviour is addressed immediately and followed up with a reminder or coaching. Equipment use and condition is logged as part of the daily opening and closing checklist. Weekly equipment walkarounds are completed by the Assistant Manager and documented using Pilla. If someone is seen misusing equipment, they are temporarily restricted from using it and scheduled for retraining. "

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Does anyone actively monitor how equipment is used?
- Do they know what to look for?
- Is it done consistently or only after an incident?
- Is it logged or just informal?
- Do staff know what happens if they break the rules?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Staff know what they’re doing” – Even experienced staff make mistakes. Supervision is still required.
- “We only step in if there’s an accident” – You should be proactively checking, not reacting afterwards.
- “There’s no time to watch everyone” – Build quick checks into existing routines like opening, handovers, and cleaning.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Assign specific roles to monitor safe equipment use
- Build checks into daily routines — not separate inspections
- Log supervision tasks using Pilla or your daily checklist
- Address unsafe use early and constructively
- Use repeat issues to improve training and update SOPs

 ## 16. Are there any further control measures you will use to protect those who use the work equipment which has been assessed?

 This section brings everything together. You’ve now walked through the core hazards and controls — but this is your chance to identify any gaps, improvements, or follow-up actions that haven’t yet been addressed.

 You should treat this section as a to-do list — especially if, during the earlier questions, you wrote something like “we don’t currently do this” or “training isn’t yet recorded.” This is your opportunity to show that you’re aware of what needs to happen and are taking steps to fix it.

 **What you need to record:**

 - Any missing training, signage, PPE, or servicing schedules
- Improvements you’re planning — new procedures, updated documents, better equipment
- Actions from your assessment that still need completing
- Who is responsible for each action and by when

 **Why it matters:**

 This shows regulators, insurers, or your own leadership team that you’re not just ticking boxes. You’re thinking critically, and you’re following through.

 It also helps you avoid complacency. No workplace is perfect — and even well-run operations benefit from tightening things up.

 **What good answers look like:**

 &nbsp;"We will introduce a short refresher training session for existing staff on the safe use of the mixer, including PPE and emergency shut-off. - A new cleaning SOP is being written and laminated to display next to the equipment. - Pressure switch and emergency stop functions will be tested weekly going forward. - We’ve ordered new 'Hot Surface' signage to replace a faded label. - A logbook will be introduced to track weekly inspections. Responsible: Site Manager. Deadline: 15th May."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Did you find any areas earlier where you answered “no,” “not yet,” or “don’t know”?
- Were there hazards with no clear controls?
- Did you mention missing signage, training, or PPE?
- Can you do anything to make things safer, easier, or more consistent?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “No further actions required” – This is very rare. Almost every assessment reveals something to improve.
- Leaving this section blank – Regulators may view that as a sign the assessment wasn’t taken seriously.
- Being vague (“Look into training”) – Add specifics: what action, who’s doing it, and when.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Review each earlier section and check for incomplete controls
- Turn “should” and “need to” statements into actions with deadlines
- Use this space to assign accountability (name, role, and date)
- Set a calendar reminder to check these actions have been completed
- Update this section next time you review the risk assessment
