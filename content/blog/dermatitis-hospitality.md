  - Dermatitis risk assessments are important in hospitality settings to prevent skin problems that can arise from frequent hand washing or contact with cleaning products.&nbsp;
- You&nbsp;should carry out a dermatitis risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is protected. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions. It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built dermatitis risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment. 

 ## 1. Who Among Your Staff Could Be Affected by Skin Problems?

 This section is about identifying which job roles in your team are most prone to skin issues due to frequent hand washing or exposure to certain substances. Rather than naming individuals, focus on positions or departments.

 This helps you understand who is at risk and requires specific prevention measures such as PPE or alternative products.

 **Why it matters:**

 Some roles in hospitality, like chefs, dishwashers, and housekeeping staff, frequently come into contact with water and cleaning chemicals, increasing their risk of developing dermatitis.

 It is your responsibility to ensure their work environment minimizes this risk by identifying roles prone to skin issues and implementing protective measures.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A thorough answer will:

 - Name specific roles (e.g., kitchen staff, cleaners) at risk of skin problems.
- Understand why these roles are exposed (e.g., frequent washing, chemical exposure).
- Help you prioritize training and resources for these staff members.

 **Example:**

 "Roles at risk include:

 - Kitchen staff – due to regular hand washing and use of detergents.
- Housekeeping – from handling cleaning chemicals and frequent wet work.
- Baristas – from contact with steam and dishwashing liquids."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider your team structure:

 - Which roles involve frequent hand washing? (E.g., food prep, cleaning tasks)
- Are there specific tasks consistently linked to chemical use?
- Have any staff reported skin irritation or dermatitis symptoms?

 If you need help identifying roles at risk, observe daily tasks or consult with staff to learn more about their exposure.

 ## 2. How Does Your Business Avoid or Reduce Skin Contact or the Need to Wash Hands?

 This section covers measures your business is taking to minimize skin exposure. Think about alternative methods or equipment that can reduce direct contact with irritants.

 **Why it matters:**

 Reducing direct contact with irritating substances can significantly lower the risk of dermatitis. By adopting safer practices, you protect staff health, reduce absenteeism, and promote a more sanitary workplace.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A strong response will highlight specific interventions you've implemented (or plan to implement):

 - The use of protective equipment, such as gloves.
- Installation of automatic soap dispensers to limit contact.
- Providing barrier creams to protect skin barring contact.

 **Example:**

 "To minimize skin contact, we:

 - Provide nitrile gloves for handling detergents and cleaning routines.
- Installed automatic soap dispensers in restrooms and prep areas.
- Offer barrier creams to staff for use during and after shifts."

 ## 3. How Does Your Business Enable Staff to Protect Their Skin?

 This section outlines how you empower your staff to actively protect their skin from irritants and emphasizes the role of education and accessible resources.

 **Why it matters:**

 Enabling and encouraging staff to take personal responsibility for skin care is a crucial component of a comprehensive risk reduction strategy. It involves providing the right tools and knowledge so they can protect themselves effectively.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer will describe practices like:

 - Instructing staff to use gloves during specific tasks.
- Providing clear guidelines and training on safe handling of potential skin irritants.
- Offering moisturising and protective creams in staff areas.

 **Example:**

 "We enable staff to protect their skin by:

 - Mandating glove use for all cleaning and sanitizing tasks.
- Educating staff on safe chemical handling during monthly safety briefings.
- Providing moisturising lotions at every hand-washing station."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Do you provide gloves, barrier creams, or other PPE?
- Is there a clear procedure for cleaning up spills or handling chemicals?
- Are staff encouraged and reminded to take proactive skin care steps?

 ## 4. What Measures Are in Place to Check or Encourage Staff to Check Their Skin for Early Signs of Dermatitis?

 This section focuses on early detection and response to potential skin issues by assessing how you monitor and encourage self-checks among staff.

 **Why it matters:**

 Early identification of dermatitis can prevent more severe health problems, reduce time off work, and limit long-term damage to your staff’s skin. Building awareness and monitoring into your routine helps catch issues early.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good response will include:

 - Staff training sessions to raise awareness about dermatitis and its symptoms.
- Encouraging staff to report early signs immediately.
- Incorporating skin checks into regular health assessments or safety meetings.

 **Example:**

 "We encourage early detection by:

 - Training staff on dermatitis symptoms and encouraging prompt reporting.
- Including skin health tips and reminders in monthly safety meetings.
- Conducting quarterly health checks that include skin assessments."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Are staff aware of the signs of dermatitis?
- Do managers check in with staff about any skin issues?
- Do staff feel comfortable reporting skin problems at work?

 ## 5. Are There Any Further Control Measures Which You Will Use to Protect Those from Developing Skin Problems?

 Finally, consider any additional steps you intend to take to further mitigate risks. Reflect on any gaps you've noticed throughout the assessment and how you can address them effectively.

 **Why it matters:**

 This section helps ensure you’re not just relying on existing controls but also continually improving your approach to skin protection. It also captures any proactive measures you plan to introduce.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer will detail actionable steps like:

 - Introducing more accessible hand-care products.
- Conducting feedback sessions to understand barrier challenges.
- Strengthening existing safety protocols or training programs.

 **Example:**

 "Following this assessment, we plan to:

 - Review and enhance current PPE offerings, including superior quality gloves.
- Schedule a feedback session to identify user challenges with current hand-care routines.
- Implement a quarterly expert-led training session on advanced skin protection strategies."

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider:

 - Are there any gaps you identified during the assessment?
- What feedback or insights have staff provided?
- Could enhancements to training or equipment further reduce risks?

 Document commitments with clear timelines to ensure they are actioned effectively.
