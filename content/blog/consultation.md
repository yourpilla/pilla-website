 Consulting with your team on health and safety is a key part of running a hospitality business in the UK. It's not just a good idea - it's actually required by law. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 say you have to chat with your staff about keeping everyone safe.

 This isn't about just telling them what to do. It's about having real conversations, listening to their concerns, and working together to find solutions. Your team knows the day-to-day risks better than anyone. They're your eyes and ears on the ground.

 In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also makes it clear that employee engagement is non-negotiable. Their guidelines stress the importance of open communication, training, and involving staff in creating a culture of safety.

 So, whether you're in the UK or the US, make sure you're regularly sitting down with your team to talk about health and safety. It's not just a box to tick - it's about valuing their input and creating a workplace where everyone feels heard and protected.

 ## Consultation arrangements

 - Responsible persons should identify the best means to communicate with staff on a regular basis.
- Include health and safety as a subject during team meetings when there is a pertinent issue to discuss.
- Record any communication when health &amp; safety matters have been discussed.
- Encourage the active participation of all employees in promoting good health and safety practices.
- Make use of all means of two-way communication to ensure that health and safety issues are brought to the attention of all staff – notice boards, circulars, site meetings, “One to One” group discussions, training, toolbox talks, etc.
- Encourage all staff to report instances they feel affect their health &amp; safety to Responsible Persons so they can be investigated and addressed. The outcome of reported instances should be communicated to all staff.
- As part of the onboarding process for new starters, all staff should receive induction training in line with health &amp; safety arrangements and employment law requirements. This process should be recorded. Employees should be given the opportunity to comment and raise awareness of hazards they encounter while undertaking their daily activities.
- Arrangements should be monitored and reviewed to ensure they remain suitable and sufficient for the management of health &amp; safety in the workplace.
