 Workplace facilities are a key part of keeping your team safe and healthy at work. In the UK, the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 set out what you need to provide. Things like toilets, washing facilities, drinking water, and places to rest and eat are all covered. It's about more than just following the law, though. Making sure your staff have what they need to feel comfortable at work helps them stay focused and productive.

 In the US, OSHA's Sanitation standard (1910.141) lays out the rules. You'll need to give your team access to toilets, sinks, potable water, and spaces for breaks. It's all about creating a work environment that's clean, safe, and supports your staff's wellbeing.

 So, as an employer, it's important to keep on top of workplace facilities. Regularly check that everything's in good working order and meets the standards. Listen to your team's needs and act quickly if any issues pop up. Putting your people first is just good business sense. Plus, you'll be keeping on the right side of health and safety laws too.

 ## Workplace facilities arrangements

- Ensure that welfare facilities are suitable and include satisfactory lighting for tasks performed, adequate hot, cold, and drinking water provision, sanitary conveniences, hand washing facilities, space to take breaks, and a sufficient temperature to work in.
- Ventilation must be appropriate and in keeping with food safety requirements.
- Arrange regular inspections of pedestrian traffic routes to ensure they are not obstructed.
- Supply training to all staff and ensure instruction is recorded.
- Arrange for welfare arrangements to be monitored and reviewed to ensure that they remain sufficient.
