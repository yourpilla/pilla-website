It is essential that different types of foods are stored separately under different storage conditions to maintain both the safety and the quality of the food. 
Food contains harmful bacteria which can cause food poisoning and illness but if you store food properly then this risk can be decreased. The following food storage tips and guidelines should be followed to ensure that foods are not exposed to unnecessary hazards and/or risks. ## Refrigerated/chilled foods

 Certain foods must be stored in a refrigerator to keep them microbiologically safe up to the use by date as issued by the manufacturer or from in house preparation guidelines issued by the food standards agency.
Chilled storage slows down the rate of multiplication of harmful bacteria in the food, even cooked food still contains tiny amounts of bacteria.&nbsp;Foods that must be kept in a refrigerator are - All foods with a use by date or are highly perishable foods
- Prepared foods that will not be served immediately
- Cooked food cooled down for future cold service or reheating
- Ready to eat foods (RTE)-Raw foods intended for consumption without prior heat treatment
- Prewashed salad
- Foods with best before dates after opening (follow manufacturerâ€™s instructions for safe use)
- Pasteurised products such as milk, orange juice also some types of canned meat
