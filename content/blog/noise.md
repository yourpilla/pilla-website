  - Noise risk assessments are important when hosting events with high sound levels, such as live music nights or DJ performances.&nbsp;
- Risk assessments should be carried out for special events or new situations were noise levels will be higher than usual.&nbsp;
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built noise risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. What is the event or activity being assessed?

 This question is about identifying and describing the specific event where noise might be excessive. Provide detail on:

 - The type of event (e.g. live band, DJ, comedy night with amplified sound)
- The location within your venue where the event will be held
- Duration of the event
- Roles of staff present during the event

 **Why it matters:**

 Understanding these details helps contextualise potential noise issues:

 - Duration and type of event can affect cumulative sound exposure.
- Location impacts sound distribution and escape into quieter areas.
- Staff roles determine who’s most at risk and where during specific activities.

 By getting a clear picture of the event, you can more accurately assess risks and apply appropriate safeguards.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Provide clear and comprehensive descriptions like:

 *“Live DJ performance with bass-heavy music.*
  
*Located in main bar area, running from 8 PM to midnight.*
  ***Staff present: bar staff, floor staff, security, and an on-site sound engineer.”* How to answer this for yourself:**

 Review your event plan and ask:

 - How will noise levels and sound quality be managed?
- Who is performing, and what equipment are they using?
- Where will speakers and amplifiers be positioned?
- How long will each stage of the event last?

 **Tip:** Use a diagram or layout plan to detail where the event is set up and where staff will be stationed relative to sound sources.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Just a music night.” - Be specific about what type of event, as noise risks can vary greatly (e.g., acoustic vs. full band setups).
- “Normal pub setup as usual.” - Even routine settings need description as events can bring additional equipment or temporary layouts.
- Relying on past events for data - Each event should be assessed independently for variations in performers, layouts, and expected audience.

 ## 2. Who may be harmed by the noise?

 This is about identifying those most likely to be affected by the noise. This includes:

 - Staff roles exposed to high noise (e.g. bar staff, floor staff, security, glass collectors who work close to speakers)
- Contractors (e.g. sound engineers, lighting techs) working in the venue
- Those with pre-existing conditions sensitive to sound (e.g. guests with hearing difficulties)

 **Why it matters:**

 Under The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005, you need to protect staff from hearing damage due to loud environments. Understanding who’s exposed allows you to focus noise-reduction efforts where they’re needed most.

 Overexposure to loud noise may cause:

 - Temporary or permanent hearing loss
- Increased accident risks due to poor communication
- Elevated stress or fatigue among staff

 **What good answers look like:**

 A concise list of affected roles:

 “Bar staff, floor staff, door staff, security. Guests in booths near stage.Contractors: DJ, sound engineer.” **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider each group and the likelihood of exposure:

 - Where are staff stationed relative to speakers or sound equipment?
- How does event setup increase vulnerability (e.g. open door to an enclosed room)?
- Does high noise interfere with staff communication or task visibility?
- Are any specific roles hired temporarily for this event?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Everyone’s at risk” - Typically certain roles and positions face higher risks and require more protection.
- Assuming customers are fine - While legally they’re not employees, guests can still be exposed to risks that impact their experience. Make sure to mitigate known noise hazards.

 ## 3. What are you already doing to reduce the noise risks?

 Highlight the measures you have in place to control noise risk. This could include:

 - Speaker placement and directing sound away from workers
- Limiting event duration to avoid prolonged exposure
- Providing rest areas during shifts where staff can take breaks
- Training staff on noise hazards
- Using sound-limiting equipment

 **Why it matters:**

 Documenting existing measures reflects your commitment to health and safety obligations, showing steps taken to minimise risks in line with regulatory requirements.

 This lets you see where additional actions may be needed.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A bullet-point list succinctly details actions:

 - Speakers face away from employee areas
- Sound limiter in use
- Bar staff rotated for breaks to rest hearing
- Earplugs available and advised
- Event max 4 hours as per policy
- Training includes noise risk awareness

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - What noise reduction mechanisms can we employ during setup?
- Do staff have access to personal protective equipment?
- What training or guidelines do staff receive?
- How is equipment tested or calibrated to prevent excessive sound?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We just play it by ear” - Relying on instinct leads to inconsistencies. Have a clear noise management strategy.
- “We haven’t had problems before” - Past luck isn’t a substitute for preparedness. Risks can escalate quickly if unmanaged.

 ## 4. What further actions are needed to reduce the risks?

 Consider extra steps that complement existing controls and reduce noise risks further. This can include:

 - Measuring sound levels with a noise meter throughout the event
- Providing hearing protection with instructions for use
- Reducing sound levels during quieter periods
- Regular hearing checks for staff doing frequent loud events

 **Why it matters:**

 New events, new equipment, or changes in configuration may require dynamic risk management. Proactive thinking leads to effective damage prevention and accommodates evolving work conditions.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A realistic list of actions, detailing timelines:

 - Use noise meter hourly to check sound
- Issue earplugs at start of shift
- Reduce volume to 75db during changeovers
- Implement semi-annual hearing tests

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Reflect on:

 - What equipment changes or checks could we introduce?
- Are there noise complaints you could pre-emptively address?
- How often are rotations and breaks enabling rest?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We’ll address these if issues arise” - A proactive plan mitigates risks before they occur.
- “We don’t have time” - Allocate prep time as part of standard planning to prevent last-minute scuffles.

 ## 5. How will you monitor these controls?

 This section is about setting up a clear plan for monitoring noise control measures during events, and ensuring compliance and safety standards are maintained:

 - Who is responsible for monitoring and responding to arising issues?
- How are noise levels tracked, and what tools will be used?
- What methods ensure staff adhere to noise policies and training?
- How outcomes and lessons will be documented and reviewed post-event?

 **Why it matters:**

 Effective monitoring guarantees that safety measures are functioning during the actual event, not just on paper. Quick responses to noise spikes or other hazards ensure safety standards are met in real-time, protecting both staff and patrons.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Detail monitoring strategies and accountability:

 *“Sound engineer monitors with noise meter every hour. Bar manager ensures staff are in compliance with earplug use and rotation schedules documented. Issues logged in Pilla, and a debrief meeting is held post-event to identify improvements.”*

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Who’s accountable for noise compliance during events?
- What technology or tools will assist monitoring, and who will operate them?
- Is there clarity on the procedure for issues or complaints?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “We rely on staff to mention issues” - Passive strategies might miss critical noise hazards. Develop active monitoring systems.
- “It’s too busy to track that” - Streamlined strategies integrate seamlessly with routine event duties.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Assign roles for specific monitoring tasks (e.g. who uses meters, briefs staff, and reviews data)
- Regularly test noise levels at various locations and times
- Incorporate feedback from staff post-event to evolve practices
- Document all findings, actions, and lessons learned
