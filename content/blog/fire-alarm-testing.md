   - Fire alarms are a critical part of your health and safety system. They give early warning in the event of a fire, helping people evacuate quickly and saving lives. But like any safety equipment, they need to be tested regularly to make sure they’re working properly when you need them most.
- As a&nbsp;a business owner or person responsible for the premises, it’s your legal duty to ensure that your fire detection system is maintained in good working order. This includes carrying out a weekly fire alarm test, usually at the same time each week, and recording the results.
- During&nbsp;this test, you activate a different manual call point each week to confirm that the alarm sounds correctly and that the system is working across the building.
- Pilla includes a pre-built- Fire Alarm Test that makes it easy for your team to carry out and record compliant weekly tests.
