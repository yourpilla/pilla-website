 ## TLDR: About Food Safety Audits

 - At some point, your food business will be inspected by your local authority. This inspection will determine your level of food safety compliance and general food hygiene standards for your customers. The best way to remain compliant and food safe is to carry out your own food safety audits.
- Carrying out your own food safety audits means regularly checking the food hygiene standards within your own sites. This should be done by weekly or fortnightly by somebody in your management (usually a Head Chef or General Manager).
- Carrying out regular food safety audits will mean that you become aware of areas for improvement much more quickly and can maintain high food safety standards all the time.
