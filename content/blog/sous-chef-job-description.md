## Step 1: Start with the Kitchen Environment and Introduce Your Business

 When crafting a job description for a Sous Chef, start by describing your restaurant’s concept, style, and kitchen environment. This gives potential candidates a clear picture of where they could be working. It’s also valuable for current staff if you’re redefining roles. While your existing team might know the basics, use this as a chance to reiterate key values and expectations.

 **Your goal is to provide clarity on:**

- The type of cuisine and service style

- The working pace and atmosphere in the kitchen

- What’s unique about working in your establishment

 Here’s how you can structure this introduction:

 **1. Describe what kind of restaurant you are.**

 Introduce your establishment with a concise label: “We’re a fine dining restaurant specialising in modern European cuisine” or “We operate a high-volume bistro focused on locally sourced ingredients.”

 **2. Explain your kitchen and service style.**

 Specify the working environment and pace, such as:

- “We offer a meticulous fine dining experience with a focus on exquisite presentation and detail.”

- “Our kitchen operates at a brisk pace, serving a high turnover of creative but classic dishes.”

- “We believe in collaborative innovation, with chefs contributing to menu development.”

 **3. Highlight what makes your kitchen an appealing workplace.**

 Consider unique aspects such as teamwork culture, mentorship opportunities, or culinary philosophy:

- “Our team is dedicated to excellence and continuous learning.”

- “We offer opportunities for staff to contribute to new dish ideas.”

- “Sustainability is at our core, and we use ethically sourced ingredients.”

 **Tips if you’re unsure:**

 Reflect on these questions:

- What is a typical day in your kitchen like?

- What kind of food do you specialise in?

- How does interaction flow between the kitchen and front-of-house?

- What traits do your most successful chefs share?

- What do staff typically cite as their favourite aspect of working here?

 Your goal is honesty over impression—describe the genuine working atmosphere.

 **Example 1: Busy city-centre bistro**

 We are a bustling city-centre bistro serving over 200 covers a day. Our kitchen team excels in high-intensity service, focusing on fresh, locally sourced dishes with European influences. We pride ourselves on a tight-knit team that values precise execution and creativity.

 **Example 2: Fine dining restaurant with a tasting menu**

 We are an intimate fine dining restaurant delivering a seasonal tasting menu that changes monthly. Our kitchen emphasises innovation and technique, with each team member playing a pivotal role in crafting our evolving menu. We value meticulous attention to detail and a passion for culinary artistry.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Sous Chef

 A good job description needs to specify the day-to-day roles of the Sous Chef clearly. Avoid generic phrases such as “assist the Head Chef” or vague interpretations imported from other kitchens.

 **Your goal is to develop responsibilities that reflect your unique kitchen environment and requirements.**

 Create 6–10 bullet points highlighting the Sous Chef’s core duties in your kitchen, not just the hypothetical ones.

 Think of responsibilities in different daily stages:

 **1. Pre-service and preparation duties**

 Think about tasks happening before peak service times.

 Consider:

- Who oversees preparations and ingredient checks?

- What tasks are essential before service begins?

 Common Examples:

- Organise and manage daily mise en place and ingredient preparation.

- Oversee inventory checks and ensure stock levels support menu demands.

- Supervise and train kitchen staff during prep times.

- Assist in creating daily specials and menu updates with the Head Chef.

 **2. Service duties**

 These are actions taken during service.

 Consider:

- Do they manage specific kitchen stations?

- Are they involved in plating and ensuring quality control?

- Do they interact with front-of-house during service?

 Common Examples:

- Maintain high standards and oversee work across various stations during service.

- Ensure dishes are prepared and presented in a timely manner.

- Communicate with front-of-house to manage orders efficiently.

- Lead tasting sessions for menu items to ensure consistency and quality.

 **3. Post-service and closing responsibilities**

 These involve end-of-shift duties and routine cleaning.

 Consider:

- Who ensures the kitchen is clean and ready for the next service?

- What cleaning tasks are the Sous Chef responsible for?

 Common Examples:

- Oversee proper cleaning and organisation of kitchen stations post-service.

- Manage stock rotation and order supplies for upcoming services.

- Conduct debrief meetings with kitchen staff to discuss service and improvements.

- Ensure compliance with health and safety regulations within the kitchen.

 **Tips if you’re unsure:**

- Observe kitchen operations during different shifts.

- Discuss key duties with current team members or the Head Chef.

- Reflect on situations that frequently arise and the role the Sous Chef plays in resolving them.

 **Example for a fine dining restaurant**

 As a Sous Chef, your primary duties will encompass:

- Assisting with preparation and daily mise en place before service begins.

- Supervising service, ensuring each dish meets the highest quality standards.

- Collaborating with the Head Chef to refine menu offerings and daily specials.

- Overseeing the cleaning and organisation of the kitchen post-service.

- Facilitating effective communication between kitchen and front-of-house during service peaks.

 **Example for a high-volume restaurant**

 As a Sous Chef, your primary duties will be to:

- Organise and manage efficient ingredient preparation and cooking processes before service.

- Oversee multiple kitchen stations, ensuring quality and speed during high-volume service.

- Coordinate with front-of-house to expedite orders and manage customer flow.

- Maintain cleanliness and order at the end of each service shift.

- Monitor inventory levels and communicate supply needs to ensure consistent workflow.

## Step 3: Define the Necessary Skills for the Sous Chef

 Now that you’ve laid out the responsibilities, it’s important to clarify the skills required for the role. This section helps candidates understand if they’re suitable for the job and saves you time by filtering out unqualified applicants. However, avoid generic lists—tailor skills to your kitchen’s specific operations.

 **Your goal is to list essential and preferred skills relevant to your expectations.**

 **1. Review each responsibility and identify the skills required**

 Ask yourself, “What skill does someone need to excel in this duty?”

 Examples:

- If organising kitchen prep, → good time management and leadership skills.

- If supervising multiple stations, → strong organisational and multitasking abilities.

- If contributing to menu creation, → creativity and a solid understanding of culinary techniques.

 **2. Split your list into two sections: Must-have and nice-to-have skills**

- **Must-have skills:** These are non-negotiable—skills the candidate must possess from day one.

- **Nice-to-have skills:** These are additional skills that are beneficial but not critical. You can support their development over time.

 **Common skill areas to consider:**

- Advanced culinary techniques and skills.

- Proven leadership and team management capabilities.

- Strong organisational and multitasking abilities.

- Excellent communication skills for collaborative working.

- Creativity and contribution to menu development.

- High level of kitchen sanitation and hygiene practices.

- Ability to handle pressure during peak service times.

 **Example for a creativity-focused kitchen**

 **Must-have skills:**

- Strong culinary background with proficiency in advanced techniques.

- Proven experience leading and developing team members.

- Excellent time management skills to organise and oversee kitchen operations.

- Clear communication for effective kitchen coordination and customer service.

 **Nice-to-have skills:**

- Experience in menu design and dish innovation.

- Familiarity with seasonal and local ingredient utilisation.

- Experience organising kitchen inventories and supplies.

 **Example for a high-volume service kitchen**

 **Must-have skills:**

- Extensive experience working in a high-pressure kitchen environment.

- Expertise in overseeing multiple stations during service.

- Strong organisational skills and attention to detail during peak hours.

- Lead and mentor kitchen staff to maintain performance standards.

 **Nice-to-have skills:**

- Basic knowledge of costing and supplier management.

- Ability to train and introduce new cooking methods.

- Experience working with diverse cuisines for menu versatility.

## Step 4: Specify the Required Experience Level

 Once you’ve outlined the necessary skills, you need to establish how much professional experience the candidate must have. This step sets clear expectations and prevents mismatches. Be mindful not to request excessive experience unless necessary, as it can discourage capable applicants.

 **Your goal is to communicate the specific type of experience required, not just the time.**

 **1. Determine if this is a trainee, experienced, or advanced position**

- **Mid-level:** You need a candidate with substantial kitchen experience who can support the Head Chef and supervise daily operations.

- **Senior:** You require someone with leadership experience who can manage the kitchen effortlessly and contribute to strategic culinary goals.

 Provide an honest assessment of what the role demands.

 **2. Focus on the type of experience, not just the duration**

 Instead of stating “5 years’ experience,” specify the type of environment, such as:

- Experience working in high-end dining or similar culinary settings.

- Hands-on experience leading a kitchen brigade.

- Familiarity with the culinary style or concept of your kitchen.

 Clarify whether training opportunities exist, or if readiness to perform is essential from the start.

 **Example for a mid-level Sous Chef position**

 "We seek a candidate with at least 3 years’ experience in a busy, high-volume kitchen environment. You should be proficient in executing complex dishes, managing kitchen staff, and inventory management. Opportunities for further training and growth within our culinary team are provided."

 **Example for a senior Sous Chef position**

 "A minimum of 5 years’ experience in a similar culinary setting is required. You’ll lead daily kitchen operations, bring innovative dishes to the table, and mentor junior kitchen staff. Experience with menu planning, cost control, and team leadership is essential."

## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 While skills and experience are vital, the right personality fit ensures longevity and satisfaction in the role. This section helps you attract applicants who’ll harmonize with your kitchen team and adapt to the working culture. Avoid clichés like “hard-working team player”—be specific about what traits and behaviours thrive in your kitchen.

 **Your goal is to articulate the attitude, energy, and work ethic that fits well within your team.**

 **1. Consider what’s effective in your current team**

 Reflect on:

- Traits that successful team members share.

- Challenges faced by those who didn’t fit culturally.

- Whether the kitchen atmosphere is high-energy or more calm and systematic.

- How the kitchen team handles stress and interactions.

 Identify key character traits that align with your team’s ethos.

 **2. Illustrate desired traits with specifics**

 Avoid broad terms—explain behaviours that embody those traits, such as:

- “Works collaboratively to ensure kitchen efficiency.”

- “Stays composed during peak service periods.”

- “Shares an enthusiasm for culinary innovation and new ideas.”

 **3. Match personality expectations to kitchen dynamics**

- If your kitchen is fast-paced: seek someone resilient, adaptable, and decisive.

- If calm composure is key: look for someone with patience, empathy, and observational skills.

 **Example for a dynamic kitchen**

 "You will thrive if you possess the energy to motivate a team and maintain quality under pressure. Our kitchen is one of teamwork and innovation, so eagerness to contribute ideas and assist colleagues is crucial. Find enjoyment in the art of cooking and embrace challenges head-on."

 **Example for a structured and detailed-oriented environment**

 "This role is ideal for a thoughtful and detail-oriented culinary professional. Our kitchen values dedication to precise execution, with respect for traditional techniques and a willingness to take on the responsibility of mentoring others. A passion for culinary arts and meticulous craftsmanship is highly regarded."

 **Tips if you’re uncertain:**

- Talk to your current staff about what character traits they appreciate in colleagues.

- Consider past staffing challenges and reflect on mismatched traits or expectations.

- Be sincere—don’t use vague platitudes; describe attitudes that align with your true kitchen environment.

## Step 6: Define the Salary and Benefits

 It’s common for hospitality roles to omit salary details, but transparency is crucial. Prospective sous chefs want to understand compensation and benefits clearly before joining your team. Even if not offering top-tier pay, articulate perks and supportive elements that make the role rewarding.

 **Communicate clearly:**

- The salary range or confirmed amount

- Additional benefits or perks

- Unique qualities or cultural standards of your kitchen

 **1. Clearly outline the pay—hourly or salary**

 Detail the specific pay or provide an accurate range. If unsure of your audience:

- Investigate comparable venues and typical compensation via industry forums or platforms like Caterer or Indeed.

- Factor in skills expected, along with your mid-level or senior role demands.

- If experience impacts salary, state this clearly.

 **2. Mention any perks or benefits clearly**

 These can range from tangible perks to cultural advantages:

- Staff meals or discounted food/drink

- Scheduled breaks or additional training programs

- Tip sharing or bonus arrangements

- Team bonding activities or wellness initiatives

- Professional development encouragement or structured hours

- Paid holidays exceeding statutory amounts

 **3. Highlight professional growth opportunities (if present)**

 If your kitchen supports career progression through training, mentoring, or leadership pathways, mention it.

 **Example section: Salary &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £30,000–£35,000 per annum based on experience

 Perks:

- Complimentary meals while on shift

- 28 days paid leave annually

- Access to professional culinary workshops

- Opportunities for leadership advancement

- No split shifts—consistent working patterns

 **Tips if you’re unsure:**

- Envision job-inspiring motives for long-term retention.

- Honesty in limitations builds trust, better than glossing over drawbacks.

- If unconventionally competitive, highlight alternative advantages (e.g., work-life balance, learning opportunities).
