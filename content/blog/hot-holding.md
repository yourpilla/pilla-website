title: How to Set Up Hot Holding Temperature Checks
tldr: >-
  - Hot holding is when you cook food and then use equipment to keep that cooked
  food hot before serving. Hot holding is not a method for cooking food but
  rather a way to maintain safety by keeping already cooked food at safe
  temperatures.

  - Hot holding food must be held at a minimum temperature of 63째C, with a
  temperature of between 65-68째C preferred. This temperature&nbsp;prevents
  bacterial growth and food poisoning. When cooked food is left in the danger
  zone (between 5째C and 63째C), bacteria can multiply rapidly, leading to
  foodborne illnesses. Hot holding ensures that food is kept at a safe
  temperature, reducing the risk of food poisoning. Hot holding helps to
  maintain the quality and texture of cooked food, ensuring that it remains safe
  and enjoyable for consumption.&nbsp;

  - If you carry out hot holding, then you should record the temperature of five
  held foods every day. Pilla has a pre-built cooked food temperature check
  inside which includes all of the inputs for staff to record compliant
  checks.The check will record all of the required information including the
  food item, the food temperature at 2, 4 and 6 hours, the date/time and the
  person who recorded the reheated food each time.

  - If anything goes wrong, highlight the issue using the using 'Issue' button
  and follow the corrective actions below. Record everything that you do as a
  post inside the hot holding food temperature check so you are create a full
  digital paper-trail of compliance.
