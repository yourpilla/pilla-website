  - Driver risk assessments are essential for ensuring safety and legal compliance for all staff who drive as part of their job. In the UK, The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 impose duties on employers to ensure the safety of their employees, including while driving.
- You&nbsp;should carry out a driving risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is protected when driving at work. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla has a pre-built driving at work working risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment. 

 ## 1. Who Is Required to Drive for Work Purposes?

 This section involves identifying all staff members whose roles involve driving. It's important to include roles that may not regularly drive but do on occasion, such as for meetings or special events. Remember to include both full-time and part-time staff, as well as casual workers.

 **Why it matters:**

 Identifying who drives for work purposes helps ensure that only those trained, qualified, and authorised will be operating vehicles on behalf of your business. It also opens the door to training, monitoring, and support, which are legal requirements for employee safety on the road.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A list of job titles or departments that regularly use vehicles for work.
- Include rare driving roles or occasional drivers, such as staff who use personal vehicles for emergency supplier runs.
- Ensure no category of driver is left unaccounted for, even if they drive infrequently.

 **Example:**

 - Delivery Drivers – transport orders to customers' homes.
- Off-site Catering Staff – use company vans for event services.
- Managers – may use personal cars for official business trips.
- Casual Waitstaff – occasionally use own vehicles for supply runs.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Which roles are formally identified as driving roles?
- Who might need to drive a vehicle as part of their duties, even if it’s not a primary responsibility?
- Have I overlooked part-time, casual, or temporary positions?

 Check your employee job descriptions, contracts, and shift arrangements to ensure all driving roles are recognised.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Only delivery drivers are included.” – This is a common oversight. Remember, any employee who may need to drive, even if not daily, should be included.

 “Staff use personal cars sometimes but aren’t listed.” – Any form of driving for work, even if using personal vehicles, should be covered in your risk assessment.

 Not updating the list as roles or responsibilities change.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Compile a complete list of roles requiring driving duties.
- Include part-time and casual positions, not just full-time staff.
- Update roles as job responsibilities evolve within your business.

 ## 2. Are the Vehicles Used Suitable, Roadworthy, and Regularly Maintained?

 This section involves confirming that all vehicles — whether company-owned or personal — are appropriate for their intended use, roadworthy, and regularly maintained. Document how you verify the following:

 - MOT, tax, insurance compliance
- Regular service schedule adherence
- Condition checks and any repairs needed

 **Why it matters:**

 The Road Traffic Act 1988 makes it a legal obligation to maintain all vehicles used for work purposes to safe standards. Ensuring vehicles are roadworthy prevents accidents and ensures reliability, which is essential for business operations.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Certifications of compliance are checked regularly.
- There’s a maintenance schedule for all company vehicles.
- Staff using personal vehicles must self-certify roadworthiness.
- A designated person is responsible for conducting or verifying vehicle checks.

 **Example:**

 - All delivery vans are serviced every six months by our contracted mechanic and have up-to-date MOTs.
- Drivers using personal vehicles must submit confirmation of MOT, tax, and business-use insurance before driving assignments.
- The Head of Deliveries checks condition reports weekly, addressing any repair needs quickly.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Who is responsible for ensuring vehicles are roadworthy?
- How often are different vehicles serviced?
- What’s the process for confirming private vehicles used for business are insured and compliant?
- How is information recorded and verified?

 Review service logs and insurance policies regularly to maintain up-to-date records.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We assume staff maintain their own cars.” – You need verification and documentation, not assumptions.

 “We don’t keep service records.” – Without records, you can’t prove compliance with legal and insurance requirements.

 “There's no follow-up if a vehicle fails an MOT.” – Scheduling repairs is crucial to prevent unsafe vehicles from being used.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Make confirmation of roadworthiness a condition of vehicle use.
- Schedule regular servicing for company-owned vehicles.
- Require staff self-certification for personal vehicles.
- Keep detailed records of vehicle checks and maintenance.
- Appoint someone responsible for overseeing vehicle conditions and compliance.

 ## 3. How Do You Check Driver Eligibility and Fitness to Drive?

 This section covers ensuring that all drivers have the required legal permissions and the physical and mental fitness to drive safely as part of their roles. This includes confirming:

 - Valid driver’s licences for each vehicle class driven
- Monitoring of penalty points and licence expiries
- Health declarations from drivers about conditions affecting their ability to drive

 **Why it matters:**

 Ensuring driver eligibility and fitness is crucial under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Employers must ensure that all employees are fit for their role, and this extends to holding the correct driving licence and being physically and mentally capable of driving safely.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Regular checks of driving licences and scores for penalty points.
- Staff declarations regarding medical conditions are mandated and reviewed.
- Licences are re-checked periodically, not just at hiring.

 **Example:**

 - All drivers must present a copy of their driver’s licence annually, which is reviewed by the Operations Manager for penalties or restrictions.
- Staff must declare any medical conditions affecting their ability to drive on their health assessment form upon joining.
- Licences are checked and updated in the digital database every six months and tracked for expiry notifications.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Do you verify licences at hiring and at regular intervals thereafter?
- How do you track penalty points, endorsements, and expiry dates?
- Are health assessments in place to ensure fitness to drive?

 Ensure there is a clear process for capturing and updating this information regularly and securely.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We checked when they were hired, no need to check again.” – Licences can change; regular checks capture any alterations or updates.

 “We assume staff would tell us about health issues.” – Presume nothing. Implement a formal declaration process.

 “Nobody monitors changes to penalty points or endorsements.” – You need a system for catching potential issues before they compromise safety.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Check licences on a schedule — at least annually.
- Implement a health declaration policy for drivers.
- Maintain digital records to track and prompt renewals or checks.
- Ensure all checks are logged, and discrepancies are addressed promptly.

 ## 4. What Steps Are Taken to Prevent Driver Fatigue?

 Driver fatigue is a significant concern, especially for roles involving long hours or nighttime driving. In this section, detail policies and practices that help mitigate fatigue, including:

 - Limits on consecutive driving hours
- Shift and rest scheduling
- Encouraging regular breaks on long drives

 **Why it matters:**

 Under the Working Time Regulations 1998 and the Road Traffic Act 1988, fatigue must be addressed as it severely impairs reaction times and judgment, increasing accident risks. It’s vital to consider the scheduling of driving tasks and implement measures to ensure drivers are well-rested and alert.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Clear policies on maximum driving hours per shift or week.
- Rules requiring breaks every two hours on long journeys.
- Special considerations and limits for nighttime driving.

 **Example:**

 - Drivers must not exceed eight driving hours per day and are encouraged to take a 15-minute break every two hours.
- Night drivers work no longer than four consecutive hours without a rest period.
- Drivers complete a daily fatigue questionnaire if showing signs of tiredness, and alternative arrangements are assessed.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are there predefined limits on driver working hours?
- Do schedules allow for adequate rest between shifts?
- Are staff required to log hours or breaks during longer shifts?

 Use systems, apps, or daily logs to track hours driven and ensure adherence to rest requirements.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don't track hours strictly, staff manage their own breaks.” – This isn’t enough to prevent fatigue or ensure compliance.

 “Fatigue isn’t a problem usually, so there's no policy.” – Fatigue can quickly lead to accidents; having a policy and practices helps prevent risks.

 “Night shifts are handled like any other shift.” – Night driving requires separate considerations due to impacts on human circadian rhythms.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Establish maximum daily and weekly driving hour limits.
- Schedule mandated breaks during longer trips.
- Set shift patterns that reduce overnight working when possible.
- Include questions or prompts in pre-shift talks or logs regarding rest and alertness.

 ## 5. How Are Journeys Planned and Managed to Reduce Risk?

 This section covers the planning and management of driving tasks to reduce risks associated with time pressure, poor weather, or route unfamiliarity. You should detail:

 - How routes are planned and monitored
- Instructions provided to staff on safe driving
- Any mandatory logging or reporting of journeys

 **Why it matters:**

 Careful route planning helps avoid rushing, missed deadlines, or driving in dangerous conditions. Under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, route planning should be part of your overall duty to safeguard employees and the public.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Clear instructions for planning journeys in advance.
- Use of software or apps to evaluate route safety, traffic, and weather conditions.
- A system to log each journey, including departure and arrival times.
- Managers or supervisors verifying route plans for longer trips.

 **Example:**

 - Drivers are briefed to plan routes the day before trips, using traffic and weather apps to avoid hazards.
- All delivery runs must be logged in our system, with planned routes and ETAs confirmed by the supervisor.
- Drivers are instructed to pull over and inform managers if conditions become unsafe (poor weather, heavy traffic delays).

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - How is journey planning communicated to staff?
- Are there checks to ensure routes are safe and efficient?
- How are external factors like weather or roadworks accounted for?

 Implementing a simple journey log can provide valuable data for future planning and risk management.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Staff decide the routes as they go.” – This could lead to unsafe decisions under time pressure or unexpected conditions.

 “We just focus on getting the deliveries done quickly.” – Speed shouldn’t take precedence over safety.

 “Journeys aren't logged, we rely on verbal updates.” – Without logs, it’s impossible to track compliance or identify issues.【”]

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Consult route-planning apps and tools to ensure safe travel.
- Ensure supervisors sign off on route plans, especially for longer trips.
- Educate staff on alternative routes and rest locations.
- Log journey details digitally, including timings and any incidents noticed.

 ## 6. What Is the Policy on Mobile Phones and Distractions While Driving?

 This section requires you to outline your policy on the use of mobile phones and other distractions during work-related driving to minimise risks and liabilities.

 **Why it matters:**

 Prohibiting or limiting phone use is crucial under rules that prohibit mobile usage while driving (unless hands-free). Distractions contribute significantly to road accidents and liability cases, making strict policies vital.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A clear ban on mobile phone use while driving.
- Specification of conditions, if any, under which hands-free systems can be used.
- Staff briefings and written policies outlining prohibited actions (texting, social media use).

 **Example:**

 - All mobile phone usage is banned while driving, except hands-free calls using in-built car systems.
- Drivers are reminded to set their phones before departure and not adjust while on the road.
- Our distraction policy is part of the onboarding safety briefing and kept in the vehicle glove box.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Is phone use while driving prohibited, and are there any exceptions?
- How have you communicated this policy to your staff?
- Are vehicles equipped with hands-free tech, and do staff understand its limits?

 **Tip:** Regularly remind staff about distraction policies during meetings or via digital reminders.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We trust staff to use their judgment with phones.” – Regulations require clear policies enforced equally across staff.

 “Distraction policies aren’t written down.” – Written, accessible guidelines should complement verbal instructions.

 “Everyone uses their phone for navigation.” – Consider if hands-free, dedicated GPS devices might be a safer alternative.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Instill zero-tolerance on phone use beyond hands-free setups.
- Include distraction prevention in all driver training sessions.
- Ensure staff sign an agreement to confirm understanding of your policies.
- Equip vehicles with suitable hands-free systems and use training.

 ## 7. How Do You Ensure Loads Are Transported Safely?

 This section addresses steps taken to ensure all loads carried in company or private vehicles for business purposes are secure and within legal weight limits, mitigating the risks of accidents or damage.

 **Why it matters:**

 Improperly secured loads can lead to accidents, damage to inventory, or vehicle handling issues. Compliance with the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 and the Road Traffic Act 1988 is mandatory to avoid incidents.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Documentation of load checks and securing protocols before departure.
- Clear weight limits imposed on vehicles, with checks for compliance.
- Training for staff on safely loading and securing items.

 **Example:**

 - A loading supervisor checks that all loads are securely tied down and within maximum capacity before each trip.
- Staff receive annual training on load weight limits, balance, and strapping techniques.
- Our logistics checklist includes load securing confirmation and driver approval.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - How do you ensure loads are safely secured before travel?
- What training do drivers receive concerning load safety?
- Are there clear procedures for checking weight limits and balance?

 Use loading protocols with checklists for all departures to guarantee compliance.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We load items however they fit in.” – Improper loading could endanger drivers and invalidate insurance.

 “Staff should know how to secure loads.” – Clarity in procedures and training updates ensure competency.

 “Weight limits aren't strictly enforced if we need to get something delivered.” – Risk of fines and unsafe conditions; never exceed recommended limits.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Implement clear loading protocols and offer periodic training sessions.
- Use secure storage methods like straps, nets, and anchors for transit stability.
- Enforce vehicle load weight limits consistently, with supervisor confirmation.
- Keep a training and compliance check record for audit tracing.

 ## 8. What Should Drivers Do in Case of a Road Accident or Breakdown?

 Defines the procedure for what drivers should do if they are involved in a road incident, accident, or if their vehicle breaks down while carrying out work-related tasks. This includes initial response, emergency contacts, and reporting.

 **Why it matters:**

 Clear, established procedures ensure drivers can handle emergencies safely and promptly, reducing risks to themselves and other road users. Proper documentation safeguards both employee welfare and company liability.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Written steps for drivers to follow if involved in an accident or breakdown.
- An emergency contact list stored in each vehicle, easily accessible.
- Clear reporting procedures once safe, including details of who to contact and what data to collect.

 **Example:**

 - Drivers must stop in a safe location, check the wellbeing of those involved, and call emergency services if necessary.
- A contact sheet with emergency numbers and instructions is kept in every vehicle.
- Drivers must inform the Duty Manager immediately and file an incident report through Pilla within 24 hours.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Do drivers know what steps to follow during and after an accident or breakdown?
- Is there an official emergency contact list in each vehicle?
- Are reporting mechanisms clear and easy for drivers?

 Rehearse scenarios with your team to identify any gaps in knowledge or preparedness.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We rely on common sense in emergencies.” – Clear written procedures prevent panic and ensure effective action.

 “Drivers inform the office if something happens, no set steps.” – Standardized protocol ensures consistent and effective responses.

 “Reporting is done when drivers get around to it.” – Quick, accurate documentation is essential for legal and insurance purposes.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Provide emergency kits and contact sheets in all vehicles.
- Update and review procedures with drivers regularly.
- Ensure incident reporting is straightforward and quick using digital tools.
- Include training on accident response in driver induction programs.

 ## 9. Are All Vehicles Appropriately Insured for Business Use?

 This section focuses on confirming that all vehicles, both company and personal, have insurance policies that cover their use for work-related activities.

 **Why it matters:**

 Ensuring vehicles are insured appropriately is a legal obligation. Business-related driving is not automatically covered under personal car insurance policies. Lack of proper insurance could result in severe penalties and liability issues.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Verification that company vehicles have valid business-use insurance policies.
- A requirement for private vehicles used for business to include the necessary insurance coverages.
- A record-keeping system for insurance details and expiry dates.

 **Example:**

 - Company vehicles are insured for business use by [Insurance Company], with policies reviewed annually.
- Employees using personal vehicles for work must confirm they have business-use insurance, submitting written evidence before vehicle approval is granted.
- All insurance details are logged on our database, with expiration notifications enabled.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are all vehicles, including employees’ personal ones used for work, insured under business-use coverage?
- How is this insurance verified and recorded?
- Do you have a process for checking and updating insurance policies regularly?

 Maintain insurance documentation centrally, allowing easy access during audits.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We assume personal insurance covers work use.” – This is often not the case, as personal policies frequently exclude business trips.

 “Insurance is checked only when vehicles are acquired.” – Regular reviews identify changes in cover and demonstrate due diligence.

 “There's no tracking system for insurance expiries.” – Expired coverage could leave you unlawfully exposed.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Request and record insurance documentation before approving any vehicle use.
- Log all insurance details on a reliable database system.
- Flag upcoming expiries and schedule reviews in your system for oversight.

 ## 10. How Are Your Driving-related Control Measures Monitored and Reviewed?

 Describe how you monitor the ongoing effectiveness of your driving safety protocols, including reviewing vehicle conditions, licensing, insurance compliance, and driver training.

 **Why it matters:**

 Effective management under health and safety legislation requires ongoing monitoring to ensure control measures remain effective and relevant. Regular reviews identify gaps and are legally considered a part of risk mitigation duties.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Set schedules for reviewing control measures and risk assessments.
- Assignment of roles for regular checks on vehicles, driver eligibility, and insurance.
- Documentation and tracking of reviews and updates, ensuring accountability and follow-up actions.

 **Example:**

 - Our Risk Assessment Officer reviews our driving safety measures quarterly, addressing any changes in legislation or operations.
- Vehicle conditions and insurance status are checked bi-monthly by the Fleet Manager.
- Training refreshers for drivers are mandatory every year and logged in our records system.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Do you have a regular schedule for reviewing your risk assessment and safety measures?
- Who is responsible for reviewing compliance with driving safety standards?
- Is there clear documentation of these reviews, including follow-up actions?

 Use digital tools to set reminders and logs for easier compliance tracking and improvement implementation.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We conduct reviews when we remember.” – Scheduled checks ensure consistency and accountability.

 “Reviews are verbal updates without documentation.” – Written records provide references for future improvements and legal compliance.

 “We adjust only if issues are raised.” – Proactive regular reviews help prevent issues before they occur.

 **Best practices to follow:**

 - Set a review schedule and maintain this proactively.
- Ensure responsibilities for monitoring and reviewing are clear and assigned.
- Document all reviews, observations, and actions taken for transparency.
- Iterate on safety measures based on review findings; follow up on action plans promptly.
