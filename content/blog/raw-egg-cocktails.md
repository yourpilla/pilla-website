  can be enhanced by nature of flavour and appearance by use of raw eggs in
  cocktails. When raw eggs are shaken in a cocktail the protein is agitated and

  follow strict procedures and guidelines so that cross contamination of food
  with pathogenic bacteria does not occur.

  Staff must follow the following safety points in order to achieve a consistent
  level of safety.
