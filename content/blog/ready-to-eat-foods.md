title: How to manage ready to eat foods safely in your business.
intro: >-
  Ready to eat foods can be high risk and must be handled and stored
  appropriately to ensure contamination does not occur. These foods will not
  undergo any further processing to remove the hazard, so the prevention of
  hazards is essential.

  Staff who handle high risk foods must undergo extra training to understand the
  hazards and risks so staff must follow the safety points in order to achieve a
  consistent level of safety.

## Food handlers

 Ready to eat foods will not undergo any further processing therefore they are extremely vulnerable to hazards such as contamination and multiplication of bacteria. The handling of these foods safely is critical to the safety of the product, therefore extreme care must be taken and extra supervision and training given to ensure compliance with safety procedures.

 ## Temperature

 The delivery temperature of ready to eat foods must be taken using a sanitized probe between packs of food or from a printout from the refrigerated vehicle. Do not pierce packaging to take a probe temperature under any circumstances. Temperatures must be recorded in the daily kitchen records.
