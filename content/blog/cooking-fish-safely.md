title: How to cook fish safely in your food business.
intro: >-
  Fish products will require extra care to ensure food safety. Steps must be
  taken in your processes and procedures to ensure that these foods are not a
  risk to consumers.

  Staff must follow the safety points above in order to achieve a consistent
  level of safety. ## Storage

  Any species of oily fish can present a high risk of scombrotoxic fish
  poisoning. Examples include anchovy, fresh tuna and mackerel.

  Once fish have been caught, they require strict temperature controls to
  control spoilage bacteria which can convert a natural amino acid called
  histidine into histamine. Histamine is the chemical compound in the body which
  is responsible for the symptoms of allergic reactions i.e. Skin reactions and
  swelling of the facial area, gastro-intestinal problems, breathing and
  circulatory problems.Therefore, scombrotoxic fish poisoning will have many
  similarities to a severe allergic reaction.  One recognition feature of this
  occurring is when a number of diners display the same symptoms who have
  consumed the same food, as opposed to a single person undergoing an allergic
  reaction to a product.This toxin is very heat resistant and will not be
  destroyed or denatured by standard cooking temperatures.Low storage
  temperatures are critical throughout the supply chain from trawler to kitchen
  fridge, therefore, the appointment of reputable suppliers is very important
  for safety.

## Cooking

 Check the texture and the colour of the fish to ensure thorough cooking, probe the food once cooked to verify the temperature.
Only whole fish such as tuna steaks may be served raw.Undercooked fish can contain pathogenic bacteria as well as parasites e.g. Flukes, roundworms and tapeworms. ## Using pre-cooked fish
