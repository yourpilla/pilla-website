## Step 1: Describe the Venue and Work Environment

 Beginning your job description with an insight into your bar's uniqueness helps candidates understand the role's context. This part should also convey essential expectations and values for both new applicants and current staff transitioning roles.

 **Aim to succinctly convey:**

- The type of bar you are

- The service style you employ

- The atmosphere and approach to working at your venue

 Use this simple three-part structure to get going:

 **1. What type of venue are you?**

 Provide a clear description: “We’re a bustling urban lounge / a classic cocktail bar / a casual seaside pub with lively nights…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Characterise the rhythm and guest engagement style. Consider these examples:

- “We’re a high-energy cocktail bar requiring efficient turnaround and excellent service under pressure.”

- “We’re a leisurely wine bar with intimate table services, focusing on customer experience.”

- “Our pub offers relaxed and cheerful service with a high volume during weekends.”

 **3. What makes your venue special or inviting to work at?**

 This could relate to your team culture, operational structure, or defining values. For example:

- “Our team collaborates closely to maintain smooth service and handle peak periods efficiently.”

- “We source spirits from local distilleries, supporting community businesses.”

- “Staff are involved in tasting sessions to enhance product knowledge.”

- “Our bar is committed to zero waste by using biodegradable materials.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you are unsure what to write, tackle these questions verbally first:

- Describe a typical day or night at your venue.

- How many guests do you serve on a busy night?

- Is the interaction more counter service or table service?

- What’s the dynamic of your team — fast-paced or more relaxed?

- Do you use manual or automated equipment?

- What’s the staff feedback about working here?

 The aim isn’t to embellish — simply reflect the reality of working at your bar.

 **Example 1: Lively Cocktail Bar**

 We're a vibrant cocktail bar known for our creative drinks and upbeat atmosphere. We serve a bustling crowd with a high energy level, and our team values precision and quick service. We review and curate our menu every season, offering bartenders the chance to innovate and introduce new recipes.

 **Example 2: Relaxed Corner Pub**

 Our neighbourhood pub is a laid-back spot where locals gather to enjoy a steady pour and good conversation. We offer a variety of beers on tap and classic pub food. The team operates like a well-oiled machine, focusing on friendly service and fostering a welcoming environment.

## Step 2: Outline Key Responsibilities for the Barback

 A successful job description for a Barback should clearly outline their responsibilities. Avoid generalities like “assist bartenders” and focus on specifics unique to your setting.

 **Craft a list reflecting your venue's reality — not someone else’s blueprint.**

 List 5–8 key duties that the barback will perform regularly, ensuring they align with your bar’s operations.

 Separate tasks into three categories of service time:

 **1. Pre-service and preparation responsibilities**

 These encompass tasks done before guests arrive or at the start shift.

 Consider these questions:

- What needs setting up before opening?

- How is the bar prepped for the night?

 Common examples:

- Restock necessary bar items like glassware, napkins, and garnishes.

- Perform basic prep, such as cutting fruit and filling ice bins.

- Sanitise and organise bar stations.

- Conduct simple maintenance checks on equipment.

 **2. Active service responsibilities**

 These are duties handled during operational hours.

 Consider:

- Is the barback responsible for running orders?

- Do they help with ice replenishment and other quick-turnaround tasks?

 Common examples:

- Assist bartenders with fetching spirits and mixers during busy service.

- Change kegs and restock refrigerators as necessary.

- Maintain cleanliness of bar counter and seating areas.

- Collect and wash glassware efficiently to keep operations flowing.

 **3. Post-service responsibilities**

 These are the tasks performed as the bar closes.

 Question for clarity:

- How is cleanup structured?

- What tasks ensure the bar is ready for the next shift?

 Common examples:

- Deep clean bar areas and equipment.

- Ensure all stock is replenished and ready for next service.

- Secure unused perishable items in storage properly.

- Dispose of waste in compliance with your bar's policies.

 **If you're documenting existing employees' duties:**

- Observe shifts to see how tasks are managed.

- Speak to barbacks about their daily flow and responsibilities.

- Check with supervisors or bar managers for additional context.

 Questions to pose to barbacks might include:

- What core duties do you cover before, during, and after shifts?

- How do you maintain bar readiness throughout service?

- What methods do you employ to support bartenders?

- How do you manage equipment upkeep?

- Do you guide any trainees or helpers during shifts?

 **Tips if you’re stalled**

- Consult current barbacks for task descriptions.

- Use setup checklists or cleaning protocols for inspiration.

- Think about common slip-ups that happen when these duties aren’t clear.

 **Example for a busy cocktail bar**

 As a Barback, your duties will encompass:

- Setting up the bar for service by stocking supplies and performing light prep tasks.

- Assisting bartenders by quickly replenishing stock during shifts.

- Keeping the bar area tidy, washing glasses, and removing waste.

- Helping with clearing and restocking at the end of the night to ensure readiness for the next day.

 **Example for a casual pub**

 As a Barback, your responsibilities include:

- Stocking fridges and topping up condiments before opening every day.

- Replacing kegs and assisting with heavy lifting during service times.

- Ensuring cleanliness of all public areas and maintaining effective waste disposal.

- Helping with end-of-shift clean-up and storage to ensure a smooth start for subsequent shifts.

## Step 3: Specify Required Skills for the Barback

 After pinpointing the duties, it's essential to determine the skills necessary for fulfilling these tasks effectively at your bar.

 This section helps candidates assess their suitability, preventing incompatible applications. As with responsibilities, avoid over-reliance on generic lists—focus only on skills pertinent to your particular setting.

 **Develop a list of necessary and advantageous skills based on realistic job expectations rather than ideals.**

 **1. Reflect on your responsibilities list**

 As you review each task, ask:

 “What skill warrants success in this task?”

 Examples:

- If they replenish stocks → they need logistical coordination skills.

- If they manage glassware → they require organisational skills.

- If they assist in cleaning → they should be detail-oriented.

 **2. Divide your skills list**

- **Essential Skills:**

 These are indispensable. You expect candidates to come equipped with these from day one.

- **Desirable Skills:**

 These offer added value — a plus if possessed, but not mandatory. Future training can develop these aspects.

 **Common skill areas for barback roles**

- Organisational and multitasking ability.

- Physical stamina and strength for lifting weights.

- Attention to cleanliness and detail.

- Basic understanding of spirits and bar equipment.

- Excellent teamwork and communication skills.

- Adaptability under pressure during peak hours.

 Tailor these to suit your unique requirements.

 **Example for a precision-driven cocktail bar**

 Essential Skills

- Organised with a sharp focus on cleanliness standards.

- Adept at working quickly and efficiently, especially in busy periods.

- Ability to listen and follow instructions to support bartenders effectively.

- Strong communication for liaising with team members efficiently.

 **Desirable Skills**

- Basic understanding of cocktail ingredient storage and preparation.

- Previous exposure to high-demand bar settings.

- Openness to learning more about spirits and drink science.

 **Example for a relaxed pub**

 Essential Skills

- Physically able to manage stock and handle kegs.

- Solid organisational skills for managing supplies.

- Standard cleanliness and waste management abilities.

- Proficiency in working collaboratively with a team.

 **Desirable Skills**

- Experience handling food and bar supplies.

- Knowledge of popular beer brands and types.

- Familiarity with basic bar operations and maintenance.

## Step 4: Determine How Much Experience Is Required

 Defining the needed skills will assist you in detailing the expected experience. This section clarifies whether you’re accommodating trainees or require specific expertise.

 Be cautious not to demand more experience than necessary, as this might repel capable candidates willing to learn.

 **Your goal is to explicitly define the experience levels necessary — not just time served, but contexts the applicant should be familiar with.**

 **1. Determine entry versus experienced level**

- **Entry-level:** You’re open to training someone with no prior bar-related work.

- **Mid-level:** Candidates should have routine bar experience, understanding basic operations.

- **Senior:** You require someone with significant exposure capable of managing additional tasks.

 Align with actual needs, not idealised standards. Erroneously designating roles as “senior” may lead to exploitative scenarios.

 **2. Define context instead of tenure**

 Beyond “1 year experience,” consider:

- Does familiarity with fast-paced settings count?

- Is experience handling bar supplies or stock needed?

- Do they require past exposure to your type of venue’s atmosphere?

 There is a difference between working in a fine-dining restaurant’s bar versus a busy night gig.

 **3. Mention training or growth opportunities**

 Declare if you offer training or expect self-efficacy from day one.

 **Example for a mid-level barback**

 "We’re seeking individuals with at least 6 months of experience in bar support roles. You should effectively maintain supply levels and cleanliness during busy shifts. Your role involves assisting experienced bartenders to offer superb customer service. We provide guidance and training to further develop your skills."

 **Example for an entry-friendly post**

 "Previous experience isn’t needed; however, a proactive attitude and willingness to learn are key. We provide structured training covering bar operations, service assistance, and teamwork skills."

 **Example for a senior role**

 "You need 1 year’s experience in a challenging bar environment, skilled in supply management, and capable of coordinating with bartenders for seamless service. Experience guiding new trainees or managing prep and closing tasks independently is advantageous."

## Step 5: Illustrate the Ideal Personality Fit

 Hiring individuals whose personality complements their skills enhances longevity and job satisfaction. By describing characteristics you desire, you invite candidates who mesh well with your bar’s ambiance.

 Avoid vague terms such as “motivated” or “collaborative” — instead, detail what success looks like in your environment.

 **Your goal is to manifest the energy and communication style that aligns with your bar's mindset.**

 **1. Reflect on your current team dynamics**

 Ask:

- What do high-performing team members share?

- What traits seem incompatible with your venue?

- Does your team thrive under speedy or mellow conditions?

- Do customer interactions skew toward quick exchanges or extended chats?

 Use key words to capture the mood perpetuated by your team.

 **2. Avoid broad strokes, think specificity**

 “Team player” is too widespread — instead state behaviours. Examples include:

- “Volunteers to handle supply restocks during peak times.”

- “Communicates clearly in high-energy situations.”

- “Easily anticipates bartenders' needs and prepares ahead.”

 **3. Match with pressure levels of the role**

- If your bar is high-pressure: You need resilient individuals who retain focus.

- If relaxed: Opt for open communicators and patient personalities.

 **Example for a dynamic city bar**

 "If you remain unfazed under pressure, can gauge priorities, and enjoy fast-paced teamwork in a vibrant setting, you’ll fit right in. Our team values proactive participation and efficient problem-solving during peak hours." 

 **Example for a cosy local tavern**

 "The ideal candidate is approachable, thoughtful, and attentive. In our welcoming, slower-paced tavern, we thrive on camaraderie and the satisfaction of aiding guests’ enjoyable experiences. A keen interest in the bar-banter and learning the craft will see you succeed."

 **Tips if you’re feeling blocked**

- Ask staff: “Who gets along and excels here?”

- Remember past hires who missed the mark — why?

- Stay sincere. If your bar is hectic, articulate a need for focused, calm minds — not someone “thriving under variety.”

## Step 6: Provide Transparency on Compensation

 Failure to mention pay is a missed opportunity. Candidates crave clarity on earnings and benefits, and sharing helps attract fitting applicants.

 Transparent talk about compensation demonstrates professionalism and nurtures initial trust, vital in hospitality.

 **Offer specifics about:**

- The pay rate or range.

- Additional benefits and perks.

- What makes working with you rewarding.

 **1. Mention pay, hourly or salaried**

 Declare exact figures or ranges. Unsure what to offer?

- Investigate local rates in analogous venues using job boards.

- Adjust based on the responsibilities — entry, mid, or senior level?

- Indicate flexibility depending on experience if applicable.

 Example:

 £10.50–£11.50 per hour based on experience
£11.00/hour plus tips, periodically re-evaluated. Avoid empty terms like “competitive pay.”

 **2. List staff benefits**

 Even minimal perks make a difference. Go beyond salary:

- Complimentary meals or discounted tabs.

- Paid breaks and session evaluations.

- Transparent tip-sharing systems.

- Employee gatherings and bonding events.

- Flexible scheduling, respecting lifestyle balance.

- Generous leave allowances.

 Example:

- Free meals and drinks during shifts.

- 28 days paid leave annually, including public holidays.

- Team-building nights and optional training opportunities.

- Equitable distribution of collected tips.

- Evening closures by midnight — no long nights.

 **3. Inform opportunities for advancement (if relevant)**

 If structured growth paths or mentorship is offered, include this detail.

 Example:

 We foster personal development via in-house training sessions and mentorship, culminating in potential leadership roles.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £11.00–£12.00 per hour based on experienceTips: Dispersed equally among the team (typically £1–2/hr)
Benefits: 
- Free shift meals and beverages for staff.

- Annual paid leave (including bank holidays).

- Regular training and role-upskilling initiatives.

- No late-night shifts — early closings by 11pm.

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask yourself: “Why would someone choose and remain in this position?”

- Maintain honesty — reality trumps exaggerated promises.

- If monetary compensation is limited, spotlight what makes the role attractive (work-life equilibrium, jovial culture, skill growth, etc.)
