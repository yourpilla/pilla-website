 ## Choosing and writing your own front of house opening and closing checklists

 Your front of house is your guest’s first impression and your last line of defence for food safety, service standards, and reputation. But when things get busy, it’s easy for small jobs to slip. That’s why clear, consistent opening and closing routines are essential.

 Well-written front of house checks help your team spot issues quickly, maintain high safety and hygiene standard and also make sure your service standards are kept high.

 In this guide, you’ll learn how to build detailed checklists for opening and closing your front of house. Whether you run a café, restaurant, pub, or bar. Follow these six practical steps, with real examples and advice to help your team do things properly, even on the busiest days.

 Let’s get started.

 ## Step 1: Walk through your front of house like a guest — and like the last person to leave

 The goal is to identify the critical tasks that prepare your front of house for a safe, welcoming service and then a secure, hygienic close.

 Before writing a single item, take two full walkthroughs of your whole front of house area:

 - Once before opening, with fresh eyes like a guest arriving for the first time.
- Once after closing, as if you’re locking up alone, knowing the next person through the door could be a customer, an EHO, or your area manager.

 Your aim is to find what needs to be ready, clean, stocked, and safe to open the doors — and what must be shut down, cleared, reset, or secured before you close.

 **Opening: Walk in like your first customer would**

 This is the shift where first impressions matter. Everything your guests see, hear, smell, and touch should feel clean, calm, and ready, even before service begins.

 **Start outside the building:**

 - Are signs clean, lit, and readable from the street?
- Are entrance mats swept and dry?
- Are smoking areas clear of ash and rubbish?
- Are outdoor bins shut and wiped?
- If you have outside tables: are they clean, dry, and set out correctly?

 Why it matters: Many guests will judge your cleanliness before they walk through the door. Dirty signs or overflowing bins can cost you a booking before the greeting.

 **Entrance and host area:**

 - Is the door glass clean and handles wiped?
- Is the floor inside swept and mopped?
- Is the host station or till area clean, stocked, and organised?
- Do you have clean menus, enough reservation slips or iPads, and working tills?

 Common miss: Dirty menus or sticky floors near the entrance. They send the wrong signal immediately.

 **Customer dining and seating areas:**

 - Are tables clean, dry, stable, and fully laid (if applicable)?
- Are chairs clean and not stained or wobbly?
- Is cutlery polished and free from watermarks?
- Are condiments (salt, pepper, sugar) topped up, clean, and not sticky?
- Are high chairs or booster seats clean and ready?
- Is lighting warm and even? Are all bulbs working?
- Is the music playing at the right level for time of day?
- Does the room smell neutral or pleasant - not of bleach, bin juice, or last night’s garlic?

 Why it matters: Customers don’t see a “cleaning checklist.” They see crumbs under tables, greasy salt shakers, or flickering lights — and those become TripAdvisor reviews.

 **Bar or service station:**

 - Are bar tops wiped and free of clutter?
- Are drip trays emptied and wiped down?
- Are cloths fresh and stored correctly?
- Is the ice well clean and filled with fresh ice?
- Are spirits, wines, and garnishes stocked and attractively arranged?
- Are fridges stocked and clean inside (no sticky bottles, spills, or frost build-up)?
- Is the glasswasher clean, empty, and ready for use?
- Are all EPOS/till systems logged in and working?

 Common oversight: Sticky floors behind the bar, fruit flies in the garnish tray, or cloths left wet in the sink overnight.

 **Toilets (if part of FOH responsibility):**

 - Are all cubicles clean and stocked with toilet roll, soap, and paper towels?
- Are bins emptied, and sanitary bins not overfilled?
- Are mirrors, sinks, and floors clean and dry?
- Is the air fresh, with good ventilation or air freshener?

 Why it matters: Unclean toilets are one of the top reasons guests don’t return — even if the food is good.

 **Closing: Walk out like you’re leaving the building in someone else’s hands:**

 The goal at close isn’t just cleanliness — it’s to leave the building secure, safe, pest-free, and ready for the next shift to walk in and get started without delay.

 **Dining area:**

 - Have tables been cleared, wiped, and relaid or stacked as per your setup?
- Have chairs been wiped down and checked for gum, stains, or damage?
- Are floors thoroughly swept and mopped, including under tables, booths, and edges?
- Have condiments been cleaned, topped up, and checked for expiry or contamination?
- Have you closed blinds or adjusted lights as needed for the next shift?

 **Bar and service station:**

 - Has the ice well been emptied, cleaned, and dried?
- Have fruit garnishes and open drink items been discarded safely?
- Are bar mats, speed rails, and shelves wiped down and sanitised?
- Are fridges restocked (if part of closing routine) and clean?
- Are bins emptied and re-lined?
- Has the glasswasher been drained, filters cleaned, and left open to dry?
- Are till drawers empty and cash reconciled or dropped off?

 **Toilets:**

 - Have all fixtures been cleaned and bins emptied?
- Has any damage or maintenance need been reported or logged?
- Is the room ready for a clean handover — not just acceptable, but inspection-ready?

 **Entrance and security:**

 - Is all rubbish removed from customer areas?
- Are doors, windows, and fire exits checked and secured?
- Is the alarm set and keys/codes logged (if required)?
- Have all staff signed off checklists and logged any issues?

 Final check: If the EHO walked in unannounced at 8am tomorrow, would your front of house reflect your brand’s standards?

 ## Step 2: Break your checklist into working zones

 The goal is to now structure your checks to follow the physical flow of your front of house so your team can work methodically, avoid missed steps, and carry out each check efficiently, even under pressure.

 Good checklists don’t jump around. They match the layout of the venue and the real-life routines of the staff using them. Grouping checks by zone makes it easier to delegate work, spot what’s been missed, and ensure that high-risk areas like toilets or the bar get the attention they need.

 The best structure is based on how your team naturally moves through the venue. For opening, this usually means starting from outside and working in. For closing, it usually means working backwards from the dining area out to the door, resetting as they go.

 **Opening Checklist Structure (Zone-by-Zone)**

 **Zone 1: Outdoor areas and external entrance**

 Why it matters: The customer experience starts before they walk in. Dirty signage, overflowing bins, or messy outdoor furniture create a lasting negative first impression.

 Checks to include:

 - External bins emptied, wiped, and closed.
- Ashtrays or smoking areas cleared and odour-free.
- Outdoor tables and chairs cleaned, arranged, and dry.
- Pavement, steps, or patio areas swept and free of rubbish.
- Signage cleaned and lit if needed.
- Entrance mats vacuumed or shaken out.
- Door handles and push plates cleaned.

 **Zone 2: Entrance, host stand, and greeting point**

 Why it matters: This is where service begins. An organised host stand signals professionalism and gives the team a calm start to the day.

 Checks to include:

 - Host stand or welcome desk wiped, tidy, and free of clutter.
- Menus available, clean, and fully stocked (no food stains, no outdated items).
- Booking system checked and synced (iPads charged, Wi-Fi working).
- Float prepared and tills or POS devices logged in.
- Guest hand sanitiser available, full, and branded if possible.
- Floor around entrance swept and dry (especially in wet weather).

 Extra tip: Consider adding a “reset timer” for music and lighting levels — many teams leave them at late-night settings.

 **Zone 3: Dining area (tables, chairs, condiments, floor)**

 Why it matters: This is the heart of your front of house. It must be spotless, stocked, and ready for guests without delay.

 Checks to include:

 - All tables wiped, disinfected, and fully set (menus, cutlery, napkins).
- Chairs wiped down, checked for stains, and structurally safe (no wobbles).
- Condiments (salt, pepper, sugar, etc.) clean, refilled, and checked for expiry.
- Booster seats and high chairs cleaned and safely stored.
- Floors vacuumed or mopped — including under tables and along skirting.
- Windows and mirrors cleaned.
- All bulbs working — lighting adjusted to morning setting.
- Music playing at correct volume and playlist (e.g. soft morning playlist).

 **Zone 4: Bar or service station**

 Why it matters: Most guest complaints about slow service or poor hygiene originate here. Sticky surfaces, unstocked garnishes, or broken ice machines all lead to delays and poor experience.

 Checks to include:

 - Bar tops and drip trays wiped, sanitised, and dry.
- Fridges checked for stock, working lights, and no spills.
- Garnish trays filled with fresh-cut fruit, stored correctly.
- Ice well cleaned and filled with fresh ice.
- Glassware polished and stocked at stations.
- Fresh bar cloths and cleaning supplies available.
- Glasswasher tested, filled with detergent, and empty of water.
- All EPOS/till devices cleaned and logged in.

 Tip: Don’t forget things like tongs, jiggers, and straws - a missing tool can grind a bar to a halt.

 **Zone 5: Toilets and guest washrooms (if FOH managed)**

 Why it matters: Toilets are often overlooked, but they’re a legal hygiene risk and a reputational one. Most guests will judge the cleanliness of the entire venue based on toilet standards.

 Checks to include:

 - Sinks, taps, and basins cleaned, polished, and dry.
- Mirrors streak-free.
- Toilets scrubbed, disinfected, and flushed.
- Sanitary and waste bins emptied.
- Toilet roll, soap, and paper towels restocked.
- Floor mopped and any leaks or odours reported.
- Doors and locks working.

 Tip: Overflowing sanitary bins are one of the fastest ways to receive a hygiene complaint or lose repeat custom.

 **Closing Checklist Structure (Zone-by-Zone)**

 **Zone 1: Toilets**

 - All fixtures cleaned and disinfected (sinks, toilets, taps).
- Paper products topped up for morning shift.
- Bins emptied and relined.
- Floors mopped and any smells resolved.
- Maintenance issues logged (e.g. broken flush, leaking pipe).
- Light off and door closed securely.

 **Zone 2: Bar or service station**

 - Fruit and garnishes discarded.
- Ice well drained, cleaned, and dried.
- Bar mats cleaned and stored flat or hung to dry.
- Fridges checked for spills and doors closed.
- Cloths rinsed or disposed of (no wet cloths left balled up).
- Bins emptied, relined, and removed to external storage.
- Glasswasher drained, filters cleaned, door left open to air dry.
- Tills cashed up, floats removed, and security protocols followed.

 **Zone 3: Dining area**

 - Tables wiped and laid for next shift (or stacked if policy).
- Chairs wiped, stacked, or placed correctly.
- Floors vacuumed or mopped thoroughly, including corners.
- Condiments cleaned and stored or left out hygienically.
- Blinds/curtains adjusted and lights dimmed or switched off.

 **Zone 4: Host stand and entry**

 - Booking tablets or books closed, charged, and stored.
- Till area wiped and drawer secured.
- Entrance wiped down (especially glass doors and touchpoints).
- Mats straightened or stacked (depending on closing protocol).

 **Zone 5: External and final lock-up**

 - External bins checked for overflow, lids closed.
- Outdoor furniture stacked or secured (if applicable).
- Smoking areas checked for ash or litter.
- External lights turned off or left on timer if needed.
- Fire exits checked for obstructions.
- All access points locked and alarm set.

 Tip: Add section headers with estimated time durations to help with shift planning. For example:

 - Toilets (10 mins)
- Bar Close Down (15 mins)
- Dining Room Reset (12 mins)

 ## Step 3: Focus on what can go wrong

 The goal here is to make sure every check on your list exists for a reason-&nbsp; to stop a real risk from turning into a real problem.

 It’s easy to fill a checklist with generic tasks like “Tidy the host stand” or “Clean the bar.” But if the team doesn’t understand what each task prevents, they’re less likely to treat it seriously. A great checklist acts like a daily risk control plan — catching issues before they cause complaints, downtime, or safety breaches.

 Before you add a task to your checklist, ask:

 “What could go wrong if this doesn’t get done and what will the customer see, feel, or suffer as a result?”

 Below are some real-world risks to consider, with practical examples for both opening and closing tasks.

 **Front of House Opening Checks – What Could Go Wrong?**

 - Risk: First impression is negative before the guest walks inside

 Checklist item: “Sweep entrance, clean signs, and wipe down door glass and handles.”

 Why it matters: Dirty signs, sticky handles, or bins by the door make your business look careless. Many guests won’t say anything — they’ll just never come back.

 - Risk: Guests sit down at a dirty or poorly set table

 Checklist item: “Wipe and reset all tables; check cutlery and glassware for cleanliness and polish.”

 Why it matters: A dirty knife or watermarked glass undermines trust. Guests start scanning everything for faults — including your food.

 - Risk: Customers are kept waiting due to tech or till issues

 Checklist item: “Log in to EPOS system; check card readers, tablets, and Wi-Fi are working.”

 Why it matters: Nothing ruins a morning service like a broken printer or card machine. If it’s not working at open, it becomes a problem at peak.

 - Risk: Slow service at the bar due to missing prep or tools

 Checklist item: “Stock and clean garnish trays; fill ice wells; confirm glasswasher is running.”

 Why it matters: Poor bar prep means drinks take longer, standards slip, and revenue drops. Guests order fewer rounds if they’re waiting too long.

 - Risk: Toilets aren’t checked until the first complaint

 Checklist item: “Clean and restock toilets before service; check for smells, leaks, and bins.”

 Why it matters: Guests don’t care who’s responsible — if your toilets are dirty, they assume your kitchen is too.

 **Front of House Closing Checks – What Could Go Wrong?**

 - Risk: Overnight pests attracted by fruit, sugar, or bin waste

 Checklist item: “Discard garnishes; empty drip trays; clean bar surfaces and remove waste.”

 Why it matters: Fruit flies, mice, and cockroaches don’t need much encouragement. A single missed lime wedge can start a full infestation.

 - Risk: Ice well left dirty, causing contamination or equipment failure

 Checklist item: “Empty, clean, and dry ice wells at end of shift.”

 Why it matters: Bacteria builds up fast in standing water. Dirty ice can contaminate drinks — and your ice machine could be damaged by freeze-over.

 - Risk: Morning team delayed by sticky floors and unfinished reset

 Checklist item: “Wipe all tables, sweep and mop under furniture, and relay for opening.”

 Why it matters: Poor closing slows the next team down. They’ll spend their first 30 minutes fixing yesterday’s shortcuts instead of focusing on prep or customers.

 - Risk: Glasswasher left full or filters blocked

 Checklist item: “Drain and clean glasswasher; remove filters and leave door open.”

 Why it matters: Residual heat and grime lead to cloudy glasses and bacterial growth. You’ll either rewash everything or serve drinks in substandard glassware.

 - Risk: Cash not reconciled, leading to float errors or security issues

 Checklist item: “Cash up tills; remove floats; secure according to procedure.”

 Why it matters: Unreconciled tills can create costly admin issues — or worse, invite theft or internal disputes.

 - Risk: Morning staff can’t start due to empty soap or sanitiser

 Checklist item: “Check and refill soap, blue roll, and sanitiser stations.”

 Why it matters: Staff arrive on time and find nothing stocked. Hygiene suffers and delays build immediately.

 - How to apply this thinking to your own checklist

 For every item on your list, quickly jot down:

 - What’s the specific risk this check prevents?
- What’s the customer impact if this goes wrong?
- Could a guest, EHO, or manager notice this immediately?

 If the answer is yes — that check belongs on your list. If not, either reword it to be more meaningful or consider removing it.

 ## Step 4: Write every task clearly, completely, and with zero room for guesswork

 The goal is to make each checklist item so specific and understandable that any team member - no matter their experience - can complete it correctly without asking for help.

 A good checklist removes interpretation. There should be no “I didn’t know” or “I thought someone else was doing that.” If a team member doesn’t understand a task at a glance, it needs rewriting.

 You’re not just writing reminders. You’re writing instructions for action, often completed during busy service or when staff are tired at the end of a shift.

 **Checklist items should answer three questions:**

 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1

 If a task only answers the first question, it’s likely too vague. If it answers the first two, it’s probably usable. If it includes all three, it’s clear, enforceable, and teachable.

 **Use clear, consistent action verbs**

 Start each task with a verb that describes what needs to happen:

 - Check, Clean, Wipe, Polish, Discard, Refill, Log in, Empty, Switch off, Restock, Set, Remove, Label

 Avoid vague phrases like:

 - Make sure, Ensure, Tidy up, Confirm it’s okay

 These make it unclear what action to take — and leave gaps in accountability.

 **Include the object and the standard**

 Describe exactly what to check or clean, and what the expected condition is.

 ❌ Vague:

 "Clean host stand"

 What part? With what? To what standard?

 ✅ Clear:

 "Wipe host stand, screen, and menu holder with sanitiser; remove any visible smudges, spills, or clutter"

 ❌ Vague:

 "Check tables"

 For what — crumbs, damage, settings?

 ✅ Clear:

 "Wipe down tables, polish cutlery and glassware, and reset with correct condiments and napkins"

 ❌ Vague:

 "Stock the bar"

 What specifically needs checking?

 ✅ Clear:

 "Refill garnish tray with fresh-cut fruit, top up straws and napkins, and restock bottled mixers"

 ❌ Vague:

 "Sort the toilets"

 Clean? Refill? Report issues?

 ✅ Clear:

 "Clean toilet and sink, refill soap and toilet roll, empty bins, and check for leaks or smells"

 **Break complex tasks into multiple steps**

 Don’t bundle everything into one long instruction. If a task involves different actions, break it down.

 ❌ Vague and overloaded:

 "Clean bar and set up for service"

 ✅ Clear, split:

 - "Wipe bar top and drip trays with sanitiser"
- "Clean and refill garnish tray"
- "Fill ice well with fresh ice and cover until service"
- "Check glassware is polished and stocked at all stations"

 ❌ Vague:

 "Tidy customer areas"

 ✅ Clear:

 - "Wipe all tables and chairs, including edges and undersides"
- "Sweep and mop floor under and between tables"
- "Check condiment containers are clean, full, and labelled"

 **Use consistent wording across shifts and zones**

 Pick standard phrasing and stick to it. Don’t say “wipe down” in one place and “clean off” in another if you mean the same thing. This builds familiarity and reduces errors — especially for new or part-time staff.

 Example:
Always say: “Wipe with sanitiser and leave to air dry”
Not:- “Clean with spray” / “Spray and wipe down” / “Use blue roll to clean”

 ✅ Avoid “OK words” that hide risk

 Words like “clean,” “check,” or “ready” are often meaningless unless defined.

 ❌ “Check if clean”

 Better: “Wipe with sanitiser until no visible residue; leave surface dry”

 ❌ “Make sure stock is topped up”

 Better: “Refill all bar fridges with backup stock; check labels face forward”

 Add context and guidance where needed

 Some checks need short internal notes for training or clarity. These help explain why the task matters — especially when it’s easily skipped.

 In Pilla, you can use the pen icon to add this guidance.

 Example:

 Checklist item: “Check glasswasher is clean, drained, and left open overnight”
Note to staff: “Leaving it closed causes bad smells and bacterial growth. Always prop it open.” Example:

 Checklist item: “Empty drip trays under beer taps and wipe with sanitiser”
Note to staff: “Beer residue attracts fruit flies. Drip trays should be bone dry by close.” **Test the wording in real life**

 Ask someone from the team to run through the checklist on a quiet shift. Watch them complete the tasks — and listen for questions like:

 - “Do we clean under the mats or just around them?”
- “Do we refill the sugar or just check it?”
- “Where are the backups kept?”

 Any moment of hesitation means the wording can be improved.

 ## Step 5: Make your checklists part of the daily routine — not a box-ticking chore

 To make sure your checklists are used properly every day by integrating them into your team’s shift structure, setting clear expectations, and following up consistently.

 A checklist isn’t useful unless it’s actually used. Even the best-written checks won’t improve standards if they’re seen as optional or something to do “when there’s time.” The goal is to make your opening and closing routines feel as essential as putting on an apron - part of the shift, not an add-on.

 When checklists are respected, they protect your service standards, hygiene, customer experience, and even your brand reputation. When they’re ignored, the result is inconsistency, hidden risks, and poor first impressions.

 Here’s how to make checklists stick.

 **Assign clear responsibility and record specifics**

 Every item on your checklist should be completed by a named person or role - not “the team.” In Pilla,&nbsp; full data-trail is recorded for every Check included who has carried out the Check and when.&nbsp;

 **Set a realistic completion time**

 Your checklist should match the time available. If your opening list takes 30 minutes and staff are only given 10, it will be rushed or skipped.

 - Observe how long it takes to complete each section thoroughly.
- Build that time into the rota - opening and closing are part of the shift, not unpaid extras
- Avoid piling all tasks onto one person - spread the work logically.

 Every work activity inside Pilla is given a start time and a target finish time, make sure that these times are realistic and achievable.

 **Integrate checklists into handover routines**

 Make opening and closing checks part of your team’s daily rhythm and link them to handovers.

 - Opening: The manager or supervisor should confirm all opening tasks are completed before guests are seated or service begins.
- Closing: The shift lead should walk through each zone and sign off before team members are allowed to leave.

 This isn’t about being strict - it’s about ensuring the next shift walks into a ready venue and doesn’t spend the morning fixing yesterday’s shortcuts.

 **Example handover flow:**

 Opening:

 - Host checks entrance and menus
- Server checks tables and floor
- Bartender checks bar and back bar
- Manager reviews toilets and does a final walk-through

 Closing:

 - Team completes checklist section by section
- Shift lead walks through each zone to check standards
- Any missed tasks are handed back or flagged in the notes

 **Train every team member on how to complete each task properly**

 Don’t assume your team knows what each task means — or how you want it done.

 - During onboarding, walk new staff through the checklist step by step.
- Show them what “clean” means in your venue — not just in theory.
- Use photos, printed guides, or in-app instructions in Pilla to demonstrate standards.
- Explain the why behind each task — e.g. “We clean the bar mats like this because otherwise, we get fruit flies.”

 Even experienced staff benefit from the same training — especially if they’ve come from a venue with different expectations.

 **Monitor checklist completion and act on issues**

 Review your checklists daily or weekly, not just when something goes wrong.

 - Are tasks consistently skipped or rushed?
- Are “completed” tasks actually being done to standard?
- Are there recurring issues being logged (e.g. bins left full, sticky glassware)?
- Are handovers between teams smooth — or are complaints creeping in?

 In Pilla, staff can mark checks as issues and notify managers directly. Use this as an escalation process, and treat recurring failures as coaching opportunities - not just blame.

 **Recognise good habits and enforce consequences for poor ones**

 Build a culture where checklist completion is valued, not just enforced.

 - Thank staff who do it well.
- Coach staff who fall short — and show them the impact of missed checks.
- Set a clear expectation: no one clocks out until their section is signed off.
- Avoid passive tolerance of shortcuts — they spread quickly.

 Why it matters: A checklist is a standard. If it’s filled out without action, you’re training the team to ignore the rules.

 **Make it easy to access and hard to ignore**

 Whether you’re using digital checklists or paper copies, make sure they’re always available and clearly linked to each shift.

 Digital (e.g. Pilla):

 - Assign checklists to roles and show them as part of the daily work feed.
- Add descriptions and instructions to each task using the pen icon.
- Use notifications or deadlines to prompt action before service.

 Paper-based:

 - Print each day’s checklist and attach it to a clipboard in each zone.
- Use wall-mounted versions for static checks (e.g. bar close down routine).
- Keep extras in the staff room, not buried in folders.

 Tip: Don’t make checklist access dependent on asking a manager. If a task needs to be done, the list needs to be visible.

 ## Step 6: Review and improve your checklists regularly

 Keep your checklists accurate, relevant, and easy to follow so they continue to support your standards as the venue evolves.

 A checklist is not a one-time job. Menus change. Furniture gets moved. Staff come and go. If you don’t regularly review your front of house checks, they quickly become outdated and once a checklist loses relevance, your team stops trusting it.

 At that point, it becomes just another piece of ignored paperwork.

 To prevent that, treat your checklist as a living operational tool. Schedule reviews, involve your team, and use real-world data to keep it sharp.

 **Review every checklist monthly or after any major change**

 Plan to review your FOH opening and closing checklists at least once a month, even if only for 10–15 minutes. Updates don’t need to be big — the goal is to keep them accurate.

 Trigger points for a full review:

 - A new menu or service model is launched (e.g. brunch, pre-theatre set menu)
- A new team structure or rota pattern is introduced
- New furniture or EPOS systems are added
- There’s been a recurring issue during handovers or guest complaints
- You’ve had an EHO visit, hygiene incident, or mystery shop feedback
- Staff are skipping or questioning the checklist

 **Ask your team what’s missing, unclear, or unnecessary**

 Front of house staff are your best source of feedback. They know what feels awkward, what gets skipped, and what’s no longer relevant. Involve them in the review process.

 Ask questions like:

 - “Which checklist items feel pointless or unclear?”
- “Is there anything you always do that’s not on the list?”
- “Which parts of the checklist are rushed or get missed?”
- “Are there any checks that no longer match the layout or flow of service?”

 You don’t have to act on every suggestion — but if several people flag the same task, it’s worth a closer look.

 In Pilla: Encourage staff to leave issue comments directly on checks when something isn’t working. These insights are more valuable than any top-down audit.

 **Check for vague or duplicated tasks**

 Read every item on your checklist. For each one, ask:

 - Is this clear enough for a new starter to complete alone?
- Is this already covered in another task or in a different checklist?
- Is it written in consistent language and format?

 If a task is ambiguous (e.g. “check area is tidy”) or duplicated elsewhere (e.g. “wipe tables” appears in two checklists), revise or remove it. The tighter the checklist, the more likely it is to be completed thoroughly.

 Pro tip: A bloated checklist is often ignored. A sharp one gets respected.

 **Keep the checklist aligned with SOPs and training**

 If your standard operating procedures or onboarding guides describe a task one way — but the checklist uses different wording — you create confusion.

 For example:

 - SOP says: “Wipe with sanitiser and leave to air dry”
- Checklist says: “Clean surfaces”

 That gap leads to shortcuts.

 Action: Match your checklist language to the exact steps taught in training or displayed in visual guides. Consistency builds habits.

 If you change the process, update the checklist and the SOP at the same time. Never do one without the other.

 **Test it in the real world - don’t assume it works**

 Once updated, walk through the checklist yourself like a new team member. Do the tasks. Time how long they take. Look for friction.

 Questions to ask during testing:

 - Is the order logical and efficient based on the space layout?
- Does every item serve a clear, useful purpose?
- Can staff complete it without needing help, context, or clarification?
- Are any steps being skipped or guessed at?

 Watch someone else do the checklist without guidance — preferably someone newer to the team. If they hesitate or misinterpret a task, the checklist needs fixing.

 **Communicate updates clearly**

 If you make changes to your checklist, tell your team — and explain why.

 - Flag new or revised items with a short “UPDATED” tag in your app or printout
- Run through changes during a briefing or team meeting
- Use training notes or tooltips in Pilla to show new standards
