title: How to Write a Food Safety Policy Statement
tldr: >-
  - A food safety policy statement is a short, clear statement that shows your
  business is committed to keeping food safe and meeting legal duties.

  - A food safety policy statement sets out your approach to managing food
  safety risks, training your team, and following best practices like HACCP.

  - Every team member should know what it says, and it should be reviewed
  regularly to stay up to date.
