## Step 1: Begin with the Venue's Style and Outline Your Establishment

 Opening your job description with details about your venue can set the scene for potential applicants. If you’re crafting a description for existing staff moving into a management role, remind them of the key elements of your venue’s ethos.

 **The objective is to ensure applicants comprehend:**
- The type of dining experience you provide
- The overall atmosphere and guest expectations
- The values and service ethos that drive your venue

 Use this simple 3-part format to craft your introduction:

 **1. What type of establishment are you?**

 Label clearly: “We’re a high-end dining restaurant / a bustling bistro / a family-friendly hotel restaurant offering modern classics…”

 **2. What’s your dining style?**

 Convey the dining experience and environment. For example:
- “Our focus is on elegant service with a seasonal tasting menu.”
- “We offer a lively atmosphere with shared plates and casual dining.”
- “Our venue combines innovative cuisine with a family-friendly setting.”

 **3. What sets your venue apart?**

 Highlight your unique qualities or what makes working with you exceptional:
- “We are a team that values creativity and culinary excellence.”
- “We support local producers and encourage menu innovation.”
- “We focus on quality service and building lasting customer relationships.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

 If you’re finding it difficult to describe your venue’s style, consider these questions:

- What’s the main theme or concept of your venue?

- What do guests expect from their dining experience?

- How does your team contribute to the guest experience?

- What are you proud of about your establishment?

 **Example 1: High-end dining restaurant**

 We are an upscale dining destination known for our attention to detail, with a modern tasting menu that highlights seasonal and locally sourced ingredients. We maintain a sophisticated atmosphere and a commitment to superior service, making every dining experience a memorable one.

 **Example 2: Casual family bistro**

 As a bustling family bistro, we offer a relaxed, friendly dining experience with modern twists on traditional dishes. Our team is passionate about creating a fun and lively atmosphere for all age groups, ensuring each guest feels welcomed and at home.

 ## Step 2: Enumerate Core Responsibilities for the Food and Beverage Manager

 When defining the responsibilities within your job description, clarity is paramount. Avoid vague statements like “manage staff” and instead provide specifics that match your establishment's needs.

 **Your objective is to create a list that reflects your venue's unique operations and goals.**

 Develop 6–10 detailed bullet points covering what your Food and Beverage Manager will handle, focusing on three critical areas:

 **1. Team leadership and development responsibilities**

 Consider what duties involve managing and supporting the team.

 Ask yourself:

 **If your managers’ duties aren't documented yet, you can:**

 ## Step 3: Specify the Required Skills

 To attract the right candidates, it’s crucial to outline the skills they’ll need to excel in your venue. This section allows potential hires to self-assess with regard to their suitability before applying.

 Avoid generic skill lists. Tailor your requirements to fit your unique operational needs.

 **Your goal is to identify both the must-have and desired skills based on your venue's genuine needs and performance expectations.**

 **1. Revisit your responsibilities list**

 For each task, consider:

 “What skill is essential for excelling in this duty?”

 Examples:

- Evaluating performance and mentoring staff → strong leadership and communication skills

- Overseeing quality management systems → attention to detail and business acumen

- Managing inventory and costs → analytical and organisational skills

 **2. Divide the list into essential and preferred skills**

- Must-have skills

 These are crucial for the role and non-negotiable.

- Nice-to-have skills

 Great additions that can be developed over time.

 **Common skill areas to consider**

- Effective team leadership and staff development

- Excellent customer service strategies and guest relations

- Cost management including inventory control and budgeting

- Compliance with safety and hygiene protocols

- Coordination and teamwork with other departments

- Ability to implement quality management systems

 Include only what matches your needs.

 **Example for a fine dining venue**

 Must-Have Skills

- Proven track record in overseeing luxury dining environments

- Capacity to maintain high service standards and attention to quality detail

- Deep understanding of wine pairing and menu design

- Proficiency in budget management and cost control

- Skill in promoting a fun yet professional ambiance

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Proficiency in using POS and management software

 ## Step 4: Define the Required Experience Level

 Clearly specifying the experience you’re seeking can streamline the application process, ensuring that candidates understand if their background matches your needs. This helps prevent miscommunication and ensures you receive suitable applications.

 But avoid the tendency to overstate experience requirements, which might deter qualified candidates who lack long tenure but are otherwise capable.

 **Your goal is to be specific about the type and depth of experience required — not just years in the industry, but the kinds of scenarios and challenges the candidate should be comfortable handling.**

 **1. Identify whether it’s a mid-level or senior role**

- Mid-level: Requires practical, hands-on management experience in a service environment.

- Senior: Requires extensive experience with significant leadership responsibilities and strategic input.

 Be realistic about what your venue needs. Don’t advertise a senior role if you seek a manager for routine operations.

 **2. Clarify the specific type of experience desired**

 Ask yourself:

- Does the role require experience in luxury, high-volume, or diverse dining settings?

- Is team management in a fast-paced environment crucial?

- Does the role involve menu development or strategic financial oversight?

 Don’t just specify years — focus on the relevance and applicability of the candidate’s experience.

 **3. Set expectations for training and advancement**

 Clarify whether you offer mentorship and training opportunities or expect the candidate to lead from day one.

 **Example for a senior manager**

 "We require at least 5 years of managerial experience in a fine dining environment, with proven expertise in strategic planning and staff leadership. You should demonstrate a history of enhancing guest experience and have high competency in managing budgets and resource allocation."

 **Example for a mid-level manager**

 "You should have a minimum of 2–3 years of food and beverage management experience, preferably within a busy or mixed-cuisine environment. Comfort with service oversight and team development is essential, and we’re ready to invest in your growth through structured training programmes."

 ## Step 5: Define Desired Personal Traits and Cultural Fit

 While skills and experience are critical, the personality fit is what sustains team synergy and long-term satisfaction. This portion of the description lets you seek out candidates whose personal qualities align with your team’s dynamics.

 Avoid using clichés like “hard-working” or “team player” without context. Instead, provide a meaningful picture of how successful candidates will complement your hospitality team.

 **Your goal is to clearly outline the character attributes and social resonance needed within your team environment.**

 **1. Reflect on existing team culture**

 Ask yourself:

- What shared traits do your top-performing employees have?

- What cultural values or attitudes have endured or struggled in your venue?

- Is your team dynamic collaborative, fast-paced, or steady and precise?

- Does your environment thrive on innovation and quick decision-making?

 Identify key personality aspects that define your team’s operations.

 **2. Provide specific examples of desired behaviours**

 Rather than broad adjectives, describe preferred conduct with actionable scenarios:

- "Embraces proactive problem-solving and service recovery actions."

- "Cultivates positive team morale and encourages peer recognition."

- "Excels in high-pressure situations and maintains a composed presence."

 **3. Correlate personality traits with role demands**

- If the position involves fast decision-making or high energy output, seek candidates who thrive under such conditions.

- For a role entailing methodical analysis and detail orientation, seek candidates with patience and attentiveness.

 **Example for a relaxed dining environment**

 "You’ll succeed in this role if you are warm, adaptable, and excel at building genuine relationships with team members and guests. Our team values collaboration, honesty, and supportive guidance, making it essential to encourage and celebrate achievements."

 **Example for a high-pressure service setting**

 "This role aligns with individuals who are driven, resilient, and resourceful in navigating fast-paced environments. You should be comfortable taking initiative and managing multiple priorities with clarity and focus, inspiring team dynamics even during busy service hours."

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Engage your existing team by asking what qualities they cherish among peers.

- Reflect on previous hiring challenges and what could have been improved fit.

- Be truthful about your venue’s pace and culture to attract the right personality.

 ## Step 6: Define Pay and Benefits

 Transparency here is crucial. Candidates are eager to know what compensation they can expect and what additional benefits your venue offers. Outlining this clearly invites suitable applicants and sets realistic expectations from the outset.

 **Clearly communicate:**
- The salary or potential range
- Details on bonuses, benefits, or additional perks
- Unique aspects of working within your organisation

>>> PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: “We offer 25 days paid holiday, a professional development fund, and a bonus scheme for guest satisfaction. These benefits have helped us retain managers for over three years.”

 **1. Specify salary structure and expectations**

 Make the base salary explicit or provide a reasonable range. Consider:

- Aligning with similar industry roles in your area for competitive attraction.

- Reflecting position responsibilities appropriately in compensation.

 Example:

 Salary: £40,000–£45,000 per year with potential for performance-based bonuses

 Avoid ambiguous terms like “competitive salary” that offer no real insight.

 **2. Highlight additional staff benefits**

 Even modest perks can enhance appeal. Consider:

- Healthcare or pension plans

- Professional development opportunities

- Employee discounts or complimentary meals and drinks

- Work-life balance initiatives or flexible scheduling

- Team bonding activities or training days

 Example:

- Company-contributed pension scheme

- Annual professional development fund

- Discounted dining across our venues

- Flexible working hours to suit personal commitments

- Regular team building activities and staff outings

 **3. Discuss career advancement possibilities**

 If providing growth opportunities, outline paths to progression within your organisation.

 Example:

 You will have access to comprehensive training programmes, mentorship support, and the possibility to advance to more senior roles, such as Director of Operations, within our expanding hospitality group.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £40,000–£45,000 per annumBonuses: Performance-related incentives bi-annually
Benefits: 
- Full healthcare cover after probation

- Employee discount schemes on dining and services

- Annual professional development stipend

- We offer flexible schedules accommodating personal commitments

- Team-building exercises and social events organised quarterly

 **Tips if you’re unsure:**

- Ask yourself: “What makes this role appealing beyond just salary?”
