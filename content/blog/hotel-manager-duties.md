 ## Step 1: Start with the Hotel's Vibe and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 When creating a job description for a new hire or updating it for an existing role, including a section at the top that describes your hotel is crucial. It helps potential candidates understand the environment they would be stepping into, ranging from the type of guests you cater to the overall culture of your hotel. This section can also serve as a refresher for current employees about the core mission and key highlights of your business.

 **Your goal is to clearly convey:**
- The type of hotel you manage
- The guest experience and service style you provide
- The working atmosphere and team culture

 Try structuring it this way:

 **1. What type of hotel are you?**

 Start with a clear definition: “We’re a boutique city hotel / luxurious resort / budget-friendly chain / eco-friendly B&B…”

 **2. What’s your guest experience focus?**

 Describe what makes your hotel unique in hospitality and service style. For example:
- “We offer a personal touch with tailored services for every guest.”
- “High-volume business hotel prioritising efficiency and speed.”
- “Family-friendly resort with activities for all ages and a serene atmosphere.”

 **3. What differentiates your workplace culture?**

 Maybe it’s your approach to teamwork, your innovative practices, or your commitment to sustainability. Consider these examples:
- “We are a collaborative team that values every member’s input.”
- “Committed to sustainable practices across all operations and sourcing.”
- “Emphasising continuous professional development and career progression.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you’re unsure about what to write, try answering these questions aloud:

- What sets a day at your hotel apart for staff and guests?

- Who are your guests typically, and what do they value most?

- Does your hotel have a laidback atmosphere or a fast-paced rhythm?

- What type of management style thrives within your walls?

- What feedback do team members often give about your workplace?

 Honesty is key—describe your hotel as it is, not as you wish it were.

 **Example 1: Business-oriented urban hotel**

 We’re a bustling, business-centric hotel in the heart of the city. Our clientele consists mostly of business travelers, and we pride ourselves on our efficient, high-speed service and advanced conference facilities. Our culture values professionalism, technological savviness, and a forward-thinking approach to hospitality.

 **Example 2: Relaxed countryside retreat**

 Nestled in the scenic countryside, our boutique hotel focuses on serenity and personalised guest experiences. We cater to couples and small groups looking for a peaceful escape with nature-focused amenities. Our team is small and close-knit, working together to ensure a warm, guest-first environment.

 ## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Hotel General Manager

 A common issue with job descriptions is being too vague or unrealistic about what the role entails. They either use buzzwords like “oversee operations” or pull generic tasks from other roles without considering what your hotel specifically requires.

 **Your goal is to tailor responsibilities to fit your hotel’s daily operations and strategic goals.**

 List 6–10 primary responsibilities of the Hotel General Manager, focusing on realistic daily and periodic tasks.

 Break them into these operational categories:

 **1. Operational Management**

 These tasks involve overseeing day-to-day hotel operations.

 Consider:

- What operational issues is the GM accountable for?

- Who do they interact with to ensure smooth daily operations?

 Common examples:

- Oversee room operations to ensure guest satisfaction

- Ensure compliance with health and safety regulations

- Manage vendor relationships and service contracts

 **2. Staff Leadership &amp; Development**

 These involve the GM’s role in guiding team dynamics and individual employee growth.

 Consider:

- How do they inspire and manage the hotel’s various teams?

- What kind of professional development do they support?

 Common examples:

- Lead recruitment, training, and evaluation processes

- Foster a motivating and supportive workplace atmosphere

- Conduct regular performance reviews and salary assessments

 **3. Financial Performance &amp; Strategic Direction**

 These relate to the GM’s role in maintaining and advancing the hotel’s financial health.

 Consider:

- What financial metrics are they responsible for?

- In what strategic planning tasks are they involved?

 Common examples:

- Develop annual budgets and financial plans

- Analyse financial reports to identify profitable operations

- Implement strategies to increase revenue and market position

 **If you already employ a Hotel General Manager but need to formalise their duties, you can:**

- Interview Them&nbsp;— Discuss daily tasks, challenges, and strategic goals

- Request Their Documentation&nbsp;— Ask for a list of current responsibilities for validation

- Consult Department Heads&nbsp;— Gain further insights into inter-departmental coordination

 **Example for a luxury resort**

 As the Hotel General Manager, you will:

- Supervise all day-to-day operations, including room service, housekeeping, and guest interactions

- Lead recruitment, staff training, and team-building activities

- Collaborate with the finance department to formulate budgets, forecasts, and profit strategies

- Maintain guest satisfaction and ensure service excellence

- Oversee compliance with quality control standards and safety regulations

 **Example for an urban business hotel**

 As the Hotel General Manager, responsibilities include:

- Ensuring efficient front desk, housekeeping, and conferencing operations

- Leading teams to achieve ambitious targets for customer satisfaction and retention

- Overseeing the development and implementation of marketing campaigns

- Creating and managing operational and financial budgets

- Implementing innovative solutions for enhancing guest experiences based on feedback

 ## Step 3: Define What Skills the General Manager Will Need to Have

 With the responsibilities established, it’s time to outline the competencies necessary to excel in the role. This helps applicants ascertain whether their skills match the requirements and serves to filter out unsuitable candidates.

 **Your goal is to align the skills with actual job expectations rather than an idealised wish list.**

 **1. Review the responsibilities**

 Take each duty and ask:

 “What competency does someone need to excel in this area?”

 Examples:

- If they must oversee staff recruitment → they need proficient human resource management skills

- If they develop annual budgets → they require strong financial acumen

- If they manage guest relations → they must excel in communication and problem-solving

 **2. Divide your list into Must-Have and Nice-to-Have skills**

- Must-have skills

 Essential for performing critical tasks from day one.

- Nice-to-have skills

 Beneficial but not requisite—developable over time.

 **Potential skill areas to contemplate:**

- Leadership and team management

- Financial planning and budgeting

- Advanced communication and conflict resolution

- Profit and loss management

- Operations and facility management

- Experience with hospitality management software

- Sales and marketing strategy

 Ensure relevancy for your hotel’s operational style.

 **Example for a high-end resort:**

 Must-Have Skills

- Extensive experience managing a diverse team across departments

- Advanced financial management and budgeting capabilities

- Proficient in hospitality management software &amp; CRM systems

- Exceptional communication and customer service skills

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Fluency in a second language pertinent to our clientele

- Expertise in luxury retail or hospitality marketing

- Prior experience with eco-friendly or sustainable hospitality practices

 **Example for an efficient, urban business hotel:**

 Must-Have Skills

- In-depth knowledge of budget oversight and operational cost control

- Strong leadership capability to manage cross-functional teams

- Ability to implement performance measurement methods

- Effective crisis management and operational risk mitigation

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Advanced understanding of digital marketing techniques

- Proficiency in analysis and presentation of market trends

- Recognition of international hospitality standards and benchmarks

 With the role responsibilities and required skills clearly defined, you are closer to identifying candidates who are not only capable but align with your hotel’s vision.

 ## Step 4: Clarify the Required Experience Level

 After listing the skills, clarify the amount and type of experience needed. Doing this effectively can help ensure a good match and discourage underqualified applicants.

 **Your goal is to specify the requisite experience for the role, focusing on practical exposure rather than just years spent in the industry.**

 **1. Determine if the role is entry, mid, or senior level**

- Executive: For candidates with substantial prior management experience, ready to take on comprehensive responsibilities.

- Mid-level: For those familiar with department-level leadership, ready for broader responsibilities.

- Entry-level: Suitable for candidates stepping into their first GM role, with strong foundational experience.

 Be truthful about the experience level truly required for excellence at your hotel.

 **2. Emphasise the type of experience, not just duration**

 Instead of merely requiring “5 years’ experience,” elaborate on setting — whether it’s in boutique hotels, large chains, or all-inclusive resorts.

- Do they need experience with certain technology or software?

- Do they need to have managed cross-departmental functions?

- Have they demonstrated a track record with strategic planning?

 Be specific — leading a small team at a quiet retreat is distinct from managing operations in a bustling downtown hotel.

 **3. Mention training or growth opportunities if available**

 If offering development prospects, highlight this to attract ambitious candidates open to learning.

 **Example for an experienced General Manager**

 "We require a GM with at least 5 years’ experience in a similar leadership role. Proven ability in financial management, staff training, and operational excellence is essential to lead our luxury hotel effectively. Exposure to boutique settings and proficiency with our hospitality software is a bonus."

 **Example for a promising mid-level manager**

 "Ideal candidates will have a minimum of 3-4 years in a leadership or assistant manager capacity. Experience in a tech-driven, customer-focused hotel environment is preferred. We offer significant opportunities for professional development and advancement within our company."

 **Example for an entry-level GM position**

 "Designed for those ready for their first GM role, candidates should have foundational experience in hotel operations. We support growth through structured leadership training and mentorship programs aimed at refining managerial skills."

 ## Step 5: Describe the Desired Personality Fit

 While skills and experience are crucial, personality fit ensures long-term success. This section helps attract candidates whose attitudes, values, and work style align with your team's culture and the hotel's rhythm.

 **Your goal is to provide a clear depiction of the interpersonal and professional demeanour that meshes with your hotel’s environment.**

 **1. Reflect on what works within your current team**

 Consider:

- What do successful leaders in your hotel have in common?

- What attitudes thrive in your environment — energetic and innovative or calm and methodical?

- What type of communication style is preferred — direct and fast-paced or thoughtful and measured?

 Note key phrases or characteristics that embody the spirit of your team and hotel.

 **2. Be specific, not clichéd**

 Avoid vague adjectives like “dynamic” or “motivated.” Instead, detail conducive behaviours. For example:

- “Knows when to take initiative and when to delegate”

- “Can balance comfort and efficiency in guest communications”

- “Values continuous improvement and team welfare equally”

 **3. Ensure the personality matches the role’s needs**

- If it’s a high-energy environment: seek someone resilient, adaptable, and decisive.

- If it’s a more tranquil, guest-focused venue: look for empathy, patience, and attention to detail.

 **Example for a high-volume city hotel:**

 "We seek a leader who is adaptable, results-focused, and comfortable making timely decisions. An ideal candidate thrives under pressure, motivating their team with positivity and clarity. You will need to be adept at balancing operational needs with the commitment to a superior guest experience."

 **Example for a relaxed countryside hideaway:**

 "This role will suit someone personable, empathetic, and keen on maintaining a sense of community among both guests and staff. Success comes from valuing each guest interaction and ensuring all services contribute to our guests’ peaceful enjoyment."

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask current leaders what traits they admire in peer managers

- Use past experiences to consider candidate mismatches and refine your focus

- Be upfront about the challenges—detail what helps a team’s dynamism or stability

 ## Step 6: Be Transparent About Pay and Perks

 Being upfront about compensation, bonuses, and benefits is crucial. This transparency not only attracts qualified candidates but also deters those seeking a different employment package.

 Even if you can’t offer the very top tier of salary, balance it with clear benefits and positive work conditions.

>>> PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: “We offer 33 days paid holiday, private health cover, and a bonus scheme for guest satisfaction. These benefits have helped us retain managers for over four years.”

 **Clearly state:**

- The salary range and any variable pay components

- Bonuses, benefits, and perks

- Work-life balance merits and unique workplace highlights

 **1. Provide clear salary details**

 Determine a reasonable range or specific rate, comparing with competitors to ensure market relevance:

- Research competitor rates for comparable roles (use Indeed, Caterer, Glassdoor)

- Determine fitting rates based on responsibility level—entry, mid, senior

- If flexible with pay based on experience, mention this alongside a clear range

 Example:

 £45,000–£60,000 annually based on experience
£55,000 + performance bonus potential Avoid ambiguous phrases like “competitive salary”—specify to encourage the right applicants.

 **2. Highlight additional benefits**

 List significant benefits or perks. Consider:

- Bonus structures and % sharing schemes

- Pension plans and health insurance benefits

- Travel or accommodation discounts

- Leadership and educational opportunities

- Relaxed annual leave policies or extra holidays

- Flexible scheduling or work-life balance support

 Example:

- Annual performance-based bonuses

- Comprehensive health and dental cover

- Staff discounts on hotel services and partner establishments

- Generous holiday allowance (up to 35 days annually)

- Regular leadership and business management training

 **3. Mention development prospects (if applicable)**

 Convey paths for career growth if this aligns with your plans, such as promotional routes or skill enhancement.

 Example:

 We nurture talent through leadership development programs, with opportunity for regional manager roles and increased responsibilities as part of our strategic growth.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £50,000–£65,000 annually depending on experiencePerformance Bonus: Up to 10% based on annual targets
Benefits: 
- Private health and wellness programs

- 33 days paid holiday including bank holidays

- Duty meals and uniform provision

- Discount on family stays at affiliated hotels

- Support for professional certifications

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Consider: “What makes an employee stay at our hotel?”

- Be honest— a candid approach yields positively candid candidates

- If the salary isn’t top bar, focus on unique attractions such as culture, perks, or development opportunities
