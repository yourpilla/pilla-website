## TLDR:&nbsp;About Dishwasher Temperature Checks

 - Commercial dishwashers need to run at high temperatures to eliminate 99% of microorganisms and bacteria in commercial dishwashers. Wash temperatures should be&nbsp;55-60°C and final rinse temperature should be&nbsp;82-88°C.

 - You need to check and record the temperature of every dishwasher unit twice per day, usually once in the morning and once in the afternoon.Pilla has a pre-built dishwasher temperature check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff to record compliant checks.
- If anything goes wrong, highlight the issue using the using 'Issue' button and follow the corrective actions below. Record everything that you do as a post inside the dishwasher temperature task so you are create a full digital paper-trail of compliance.
