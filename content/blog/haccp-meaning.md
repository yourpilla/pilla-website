 ## The history of HACCP and how it used today.

 Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, or HACCP, is a system that was developed in the 1960s by the Pillsbury Company and the NASA Space Agency. The goal of HACCP was to create a food safety management system that could be used in the space program. However, the system proved to be so effective that it soon began to be adopted by food processors and retailers throughout the world.
Today, the HACCP system is considered to be the gold standard for food safety. The system is based on seven principles, which are designed to identify and control food safety hazards. HACCP principles aim to identify a food safety hazard at each stage of the food production process, and then put in place controls to minimize the risk of contamination.To do this, HACCP plans must be tailored to the specific needs of each food company. For example, a company that produces canned soup will have a different HACCP plan than a company that produces fresh fruits and vegetables.However, all HACCP plans must follow certain key steps, such as conducting a hazard analysis, establishing critical control points, and monitoring and verifying compliance with the plan. By following these steps, companies can ensure that their products are safe to eat and meet all regulatory requirements.
