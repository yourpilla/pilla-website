 Lifting equipment is a key part of many jobs in hospitality, from kitchens to housekeeping. But it's not without risks. In the UK, laws like the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations (LOLER) 1998 and the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) 1998 set out rules for safely using lifting equipment at work. This includes things like passenger and goods lifts, dumb waiters, kitchen elevators, and vehicle tail lifts.

 Employers must make sure all lifting equipment is fit for purpose, well-maintained, and regularly checked by a competent person. Staff need to be trained on how to use the equipment safely too. Risk assessments are a must to spot any dangers and put control measures in place.

 In the US, OSHA has standards for things like powered platforms, manlifts, and vehicle-mounted work platforms. Their rules cover areas like safe use, maintenance, and inspection of lifting equipment. Just like in the UK, employers have to assess the risks and take steps to keep workers safe.

 So, while lifting equipment can be a big help in hospitality, it's crucial to manage it properly. Having clear safety rules and procedures as part of your health and safety management system is key. This helps you meet legal duties and, most importantly, protects your staff from harm.

 ## Lifting Equipment Arrangements

 The passenger lifts installed on site are not used for work purposes; however, the LOLER regulations still apply.. Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act imposes responsibilities, so far as reasonably practicable, on an employer in connection with their business. They still have some responsibility for the health and safety of people they don't employ. This includes members of the public who use the passenger lift on site and those people who may work on or inspect the lift.

 As the risks may be the same as when using lifts in connection with work, a similar regime of maintenance, inspection, and examination to that required under LOLER and PUWER will be entirely 'reasonably practicable' in managing the risks.

 Current legislation requires a competent person (many employers choose to use an engineer surveyor employed by an insurance company) to carry out regular thorough examinations and tests of the passenger lifts to ensure that they remain capable of lifting and supporting their safe working load. This is a specific test and examination for statutory purposes, required every 6 months as the passenger lifts are used to lift people. Routine maintenance alone will not meet this legal requirement.

 You have a duty to ensure that others who might be affected by the operation of passenger lifts, in your premises, are not exposed to risk from lifting operations and lifting equipment. Responsible persons identified in the House Responsibility Chart will be responsible for addressing these safety arrangements for the management of passenger lifts on your premises.
