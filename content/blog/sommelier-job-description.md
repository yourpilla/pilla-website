## Step 1: Describe your Venue and Introduce Your Wine Program

 When crafting a job description for a sommelier, it’s crucial to start with an introduction to your restaurant and wine program. This helps prospective candidates understand the unique attributes of your dining environment and service offerings.

 **Your goal is to give potential applicants a clear understanding of:**

- The ambience and style of your restaurant

- The nature of your wine list and service

- The experience they can expect as part of your team

 Use this simple 3-part structure to guide you:

 **1. What type of dining establishment are you?**

 Begin with a straightforward label: “We’re a fine-dining restaurant / a bustling bistro / a luxury hotel dining room / a casual wine bar...”

 **2. What’s your wine program like?**

 Detail the scale, style, and focus of your wine service. For example:

- “We offer a curated selection of over 200 wines with a focus on local vineyards.”

- “Our sommelier team guides guests through an extensive global wine list.”

- “We specialise in natural and organic wines, complementing our seasonal menu.”

 **3. What makes your place appealing or unique to work at?**

 This could focus on team culture, special projects, or values. Examples include:

- “Our team thrives on collaboration and sharing knowledge about wine.”

- “We support continuous education with regular tastings and producer visits.”

- “We are committed to sustainability and have a strong focus on organic practices.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

 Consider these questions first:

- What’s a typical night like in your restaurant?

- How many wines are typically available by the glass?

- Do sommeliers spend time engaging with guests or focus more on inventory management?

- What is the pace and style of wine service during busy periods?

- What do staff usually say they appreciate about your venue?

 You’re aiming to be informative, not to glamorise. Truthfully describe your venue’s operations.

 **Example 1: Fine dining venue**

 Join our elegant, Michelin-starred restaurant where we offer an exemplary dining experience and an extensive wine list. Our sommeliers are integral to guiding guests through our thoughtfully curated selection of over 400 wines from around the world, with a special focus on rare vintage Champagnes.

 **Example 2: Casual wine bar**

 We’re a relaxed, bustling wine bar in the heart of the city, offering over 80 wines by the glass. Our sommelier team fosters an inclusive atmosphere, helping patrons discover new favourites among our selection of organic and biodynamic wines.

## Step 2: Outline Key Responsibilities for the Sommelier

 A frequent mistake in job descriptions is being overly vague or using generic phrases that could apply to any wine service role across different venues.

 **Your goal is to tailor a list of responsibilities that reflects the unique operations of your wine program.**

 Provide 6–10 bullet points detailing the sommelier’s responsibilities within your restaurant’s specific context.

 Structure the role by daily phases to simplify the writing process and think through the full service:

 **1. Pre-service responsibilities**

 Tasks completed before the restaurant opens for service.

 Ask yourself:

- Who handles the wine preparation or decanting before service starts?

- What preparation is necessary for special events or tastings?

 Common examples:

- Curate wine pairings for the day's tasting menu

- Ensure sufficient stock of popular selections for service

- Check and polish glassware and wine tools

 **2. Wine service responsibilities**

 Core tasks performed during open hours.

 Ask yourself:

- Is the sommelier expected to engage with guests about wine?

- Are they responsible for training staff or managing a cellar?

 Common examples:

- Advise guests and provide wine pairings that complement dishes

- Manage the presentation and pouring of wines at the table

- Oversee the replenishment of the wine cellar and bar stock

 **3. Post-service responsibilities**

 Tasks that wrap up each shift.

 Ask yourself:

- Who handles the end-of-night inventory and restocking?

- What administrative tasks are involved after service?

 Common examples:

- Update inventory records and report any shortages

- Coordinate with suppliers for the next day's deliveries

- Assist with cellar organisation and wine storage maintenance

 **If you have existing sommeliers:**

- Observe Their Habits:&nbsp;Notice how they handle wine recommendations, handling of wines, and interaction with guests.

- Seek Their Suggestions:&nbsp;Ask for a rundown of their daily routines to ensure all tasks are considered.

- Discuss with Managers:&nbsp;Gather insights from management about key operational expectations.

 Questions to ask your Sommeliers:

- What are your main duties before, during, and after service?

- How do you ensure wines are served at optimal quality?

- What processes do you follow for cellar management?

- How do you work to improve the wine knowledge of the entire staff?

- How do you decide on wine pairings with our menu items?

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Watch how your sommeliers run a shift and take note of their routine.

- Look at how your wine list is laid out — what tasks does that support?

- If something is consistently challenging, highlight similar responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings.

 **Example for a high-end restaurant**

 As a sommelier, your main responsibilities will include:

- Design wine pairings for seasonal tasting menus

- Guide guests in selecting wines that align with their preferences and our dishes

- Manage the systematic ordering and organisation of the wine cellar

- Lead regular staff training on wine service and selection

 **Example for a casual setting**

 As a sommelier, your main responsibilities will include:

- Recommend and serve wines that cater to diverse palate preferences

- Contribute to wine menu updates with seasonal selections

- Engage customers by sharing stories and insights about our wine collection

- Assist in maintaining a clean and efficient stockroom and bar

## Step 3: Identify the Skills Needed for the Role

 With the responsibilities laid out, it’s time to identify the skills required for successful performance in your establishment.

 This section aids applicants in self-assessment and prevents time wasters. Avoid a one-size-fits-all list, making it specific to your restaurant’s actual needs.

 **Your goal is to create a precise list of necessary and preferred skills grounded in your operations.**

 **1. Review your responsibilities list**

 Link each responsibility to a corresponding skill:

 Example:

- If they must conduct wine tastings → they need strong public speaking skills

- If they oversee stock → they need effective inventory management skills

- If they liaise with suppliers → they need good negotiation skills

 **2. Divide your list into essential and desirable skills**

- Must-have skills: Critical from the start for effective performance

- Nice-to-have skills: Advantageous but not mandatory, often improvable with training

 **Consider these common sommelier skill areas:**

- Comprehensive wine knowledge (regions, varietals, vintages)

- Strong palate and sensory recognition

- Customer service and interpersonal communication

- Inventory management and stock rotation

- Decanting and proper wine service techniques

- Team training and mentorship

 **Example for a fine-dining environment**

 Must-Have Skills

- Extensive understanding of global wine regions and varieties

- Proficiency in crafting structured wine pairings

- Confident guest interaction with tailored wine recommendations

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Experience in managing a large wine inventory system

- Certification from a renowned wine education body

- Background in or passion for artisanal spirits or speciality drinks

 **Example for a casual wine bar**

 Must-Have Skills

- Proven ability to engage customers and make wine approachable

- Basic wine service skills including pouring and decanting

- A passion for sharing wine knowledge and insights

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Prior experience in a similar role, with demonstrated wine sales success

- Ability to conduct casual wine tastings and events

- Enthusiasm for learning and evolving within a dynamic team

## Step 4: Define Experience Requirements

 Now that skills are outlined, you need to be clear about the level and type of experience necessary. This clarity helps align candidate expectations and avoids mismatches during hiring.

 However, don't overestimate the experience needed or you risk deterring capable applicants who are trainable.

 **Your goal is to specify the exact experience required, highlighting both duration and relevant settings.**

 **1. Decide if the role is entry-level, experienced, or advanced**

- Entry-level: Open to training someone new to wine or with minimal professional experience.

- Mid-level: Requires direct, hands-on experience in a sommelier or similar role.

- Senior: Seeks individuals who can lead a wine program, train staff, or execute special events.

 Be candid about what the role genuinely requires; a title should not imply more than the tasks demand.

 **2. Focus on relevant experience, not just the timeline**

 Instead of emphasizing “years of experience,” detail the contextual setting. Consider:

- Do they need exposure to high-paced, fine-dining environments?

- Should they be familiar with manual wine inventory systems?

- Is prior customer engagement in wine selection essential for your style of service?

 It’s better to define quality of experience over just its length.

 **3. Indicate whether training will be provided or expected**

 Clarify if the role involves training or if immediate proficiency is required.

 **Example for an experienced sommelier**

 "We are seeking someone with at least 1-2 years of hands-on experience in a sommelier role within a comparable dining environment. Familiarity with extensive wine lists and the confidence to guide guests’ wine selections are essential from the outset. Training on specific wine pairings and cellar systems will be provided."

 **Example for a trainee-friendly venue**

 "While no professional certificate is necessary, you should demonstrate a keen interest in wine and willingness to learn swiftly. We provide comprehensive training on our wine selection, service protocols, and guest interactions."

 **Example for a senior-level position**

 "You should possess at least 3 years in a premium wine service role, with demonstrated skills in leading tastings, mentoring junior sommeliers, and managing an extensive wine inventory. Previous experience in fine dining settings will be advantageous."

## Step 5: Extend your Cultural and Personality Fit Description

 While skills are foundational, the right personality ensures a successful team fit. This section allows you to align applicants’ attitudes and dispositions with your establishment's ethos.

 Avoid vague statements like “customer-focused” or “results-oriented” — these lack insight.

 Instead, convey the actual qualities and demeanour that thrive in your specific setup.

 **Your goal is to align the candidate’s energy, interaction style, and teamwork approach with your restaurant’s culture.**

 **1. Reflect on your most successful team members**

 Consider:

- Which traits are common among your outstanding staff?

- In what areas have previous hires struggled?

- Is your service style formal and poised, or casual and engaging?

- Is guest interaction expected to be detailed and educational?

 Identify a few words that encapsulate the needed energy and attitude.

 **2. Be specific, not generic**

 Instead of “team player,” describe the behaviours you observe. For instance:

- “Proactively support team service efforts during high-volume periods”

- “Elevates guest experience with informed, concise interactions”

- “Predicts and discusses customer preferences effectively”

 **3. Match the personality to the venue’s pace and style**

- If fast-paced and high-pressure: you require someone level-headed and efficient.

- If relaxed and customer-focused: you need someone personable and attentive.

 **Example for a luxury restaurant**

 "Ideal candidates are those who remain composed under pressure, are highly organised, and excel at providing a personalised guest experience. You should demonstrate an eye for precision and a passion for sharing comprehensive wine knowledge."

 **Example for a vibrant wine bar**

 "This role is perfect for someone with a lively personality and a knack for making every guest feel special. We seek candidates who are naturally enthusiastic, proactive in suggesting wines, and engaging in conversation with patrons about our selection."

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Ask your staff: “What makes a work environment gratifying for you?”

- Consider past hires who lacked the necessary attributes — what were they?

- Keep descriptions authentic and focused on real needs, not idealistic hopes.

## Step 6: Be Clear About Compensation and Benefits

 The compensation and benefits section is vital yet often overlooked. Be transparent about what the role pays and the rewards employees can expect. This openness attracts genuine interest and prevents recruitment challenges.

 Even if financial compensation isn’t the highest, honesty about perks and the work environment demonstrates professionalism and builds good faith.

 **Clearly outline:**

- The salary or pay rate

- Additional benefits or incentives

- What sets your workplace environment apart

 **1. Be explicit about salary — hourly or salaried rates**

 Include a definitive range or rate. If uncertain:

- Survey local venues’ offerings on platforms like Caterer and local job lists

- Consider the expected range of experience (junior, intermediate, senior)

- If flexibility in pay is present, mention that — but provide a spectrum

 Example:

 £30,000–£35,000 per annum depending on experience

 £15/hour plus a share of service charge, reviewed semi-annually

 Avoid terms like “competitive salary” which lack specificity.

 **2. Detail any employee benefits**

 Mainly explore options beyond financial reward:

- Complimentary or reduced-price meals

- Specialised wine training or educational incentives

- Shared tips or bonus programs

- Team-building and social outings

- Health or wellness initiatives

- Flexible scheduling or fixed rotas

- Generous holiday packages

 Example:

- 50% off meals and beverages when not on shift

- Continuous learning with funded WSET courses

- Quarterly wine tasting events and producer visits

- Share of tips across the team

- Holiday closure for family time

 **3. Highlight any career progression opportunities**

 If you offer growth or development paths, such as leadership roles or courses, mention them.

 Example:

 We nurture professional growth with avenues for culinary specialisation, sponsorship for industry certifications, and pathways to leadership in wine or management roles.

 **Example section: Compensation &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £30,000–£35,000 per annum based on experience
Bonuses: A share of the service charge and sales incentives

Benefits: 
- Free meals and wine tastings

- 30 days paid holiday annually

- Professional WSET certifications funded

- Inclusive team events quarterly

- Work-life balance initiatives prioritising staff health

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Ask: “What would make a candidate excited to work here?”

- Don’t overpromise; clear, honest terms attract loyal applicants

- If pay isn’t the most competitive, spotlight other positives like culture, development, or work-life balance
