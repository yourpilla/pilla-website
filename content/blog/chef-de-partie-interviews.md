## Step 3. Create Technical and Scenario-Based Questions for Chef de Partie

Good Chef de Partie interviews test technical competency, section management, quality consistency, and team leadership instincts. Your questions should reveal how candidates think under pressure and approach real kitchen challenges.

**Your goal is to understand their problem-solving process, technical depth, and leadership instincts through questions that mirror your actual operational challenges.**

Effective Chef de Partie questions combine three types:

**1. Behavioural Questions: Past Experience Analysis**

These questions reveal established patterns of thinking and action. Structure them to understand not just what they did, but how they approached challenges.

**How to Build Effective Behavioural Questions:**

- Start broad, then drill down: "Tell me about your current section" → "How do you maintain consistency during your busiest service?"
- Focus on process: "Walk me through your thinking when..." rather than just outcomes
- Cover critical competency areas: section management, quality control, junior staff development, pressure management, continuous improvement

**Advanced Behavioural Question Framework:**

**Section Management Competency:**
- **Opening Question:** "Describe a typical prep day on your section from start to finish."
  - *Follow-up probes:* "How do you prioritise tasks when everything seems urgent?" "What systems do you use to track prep completion?"
  - *Watch for:* Systematic approach, priority management, quality checkpoints

- **Quality Focus:** "Tell me about a time when your section's quality standards were challenged during busy service."
  - *Follow-up probes:* "How did you identify the quality issue?" "What immediate actions did you take?" "How did you prevent it recurring?"
  - *Watch for:* Quality awareness, immediate problem-solving, preventive thinking

**Team Leadership Assessment:**
- **Training Approach:** "Describe how you've trained a junior chef who was struggling with your section's requirements."
  - *Follow-up probes:* "What specific techniques did you use?" "How did you balance training with service demands?" "How did you measure improvement?"
  - *Watch for:* Patient teaching approach, structured development, performance measurement

- **Team Integration:** "Give me an example of how you've handled conflict or tension with a colleague during service."
  - *Follow-up probes:* "What was your immediate response?" "How did you ensure service wasn't affected?" "What did you do after service?"
  - *Watch for:* Professional conflict resolution, service priority, relationship repair

**2. Scenario-Based Questions: Real-Time Problem Solving**

These questions test decision-making under pressure using realistic kitchen challenges. Build scenarios based on your actual operational problems.

**How to Build Effective Scenario Questions:**

- Use your kitchen's real challenges: actual equipment, typical problems, your service pressures
- Start with single problems, escalate to multiple simultaneous issues
- Include time pressure and competing priorities
- Push for specific step-by-step solutions

**Progressive Scenario Framework:**

**Level 1: Single Problem Scenarios**
- **Equipment Challenge:** "You arrive for prep and discover your section's main oven is completely broken. Service starts in 4 hours, and you have 60 covers booked. What's your action plan?"
  - *Assessment focus:* Immediate problem assessment, alternative solutions, service adaptation
  - *Look for:* Calm analysis, practical alternatives, communication with management

- **Ingredient Issue:** "Your supplier calls 2 hours before service to say your main protein delivery is delayed until tomorrow. Your section serves 40% of tonight's menu. Walk me through your response."
  - *Assessment focus:* Menu adaptation, guest communication, quality maintenance
  - *Look for:* Creative solutions, guest consideration, team coordination

**Level 2: Multiple Problem Scenarios**
- **Compound Challenge:** "During Saturday night service, your commis calls in sick, your salamander stops working, and a large table orders multiple dietary modifications to your section's dishes. How do you handle this?"
  - *Assessment focus:* Priority management, delegation, service continuity
  - *Look for:* Systematic problem-solving, team utilisation, quality maintenance

**Level 3: Leadership Under Pressure**
- **Team Crisis:** "Your junior chef makes a major mistake that affects 8 tables' orders during peak service. They're clearly upset and other sections are getting frustrated. What's your immediate action?"
  - *Assessment focus:* Leadership under pressure, service recovery, team management
  - *Look for:* Supportive leadership, service priority, post-service development

**3. Technical Deep-Dive Questions: Competency Verification**

Test specific technical knowledge relevant to your menu and section requirements.

**Menu-Specific Technical Questions:**

Adapt these based on your actual menu:

**For Grill Section:**
- "Walk me through your approach to cooking a perfect medium-rare steak during busy service when you have 6 different proteins on the grill simultaneously."
- *Follow-up:* "How do you maintain consistent doneness?" "What's your resting and timing strategy?"

**For Sauce Section:**
- "Describe your process for maintaining emulsion sauces during a 3-hour service period."
- *Follow-up:* "How do you recover a broken sauce during service?" "What's your quality control process?"

**For Pastry Section:**
- "Explain how you'd maintain chocolate tempering consistency in a hot kitchen during summer service."
- *Follow-up:* "What environmental factors affect your section?" "How do you adapt techniques seasonally?"

**Advanced Question Techniques:**

**The Follow-Up Probe Method:**
Never accept the first answer. Drill deeper:
- Initial: "How do you handle busy service?"
- Probe 1: "Give me a specific example from last Saturday."
- Probe 2: "What exactly did you do when you fell behind?"
- Probe 3: "How did you communicate with your team during that?"

**The Escalation Technique:**
Build complexity progressively:
- Base scenario: Single problem during quiet service
- Add pressure: Same problem during peak service  
- Add complexity: Multiple problems simultaneously
- Add leadership: Team member struggling during crisis

**The Real Kitchen Test:**
Use your actual operational challenges:
- "We had this exact situation last week [describe real incident]. How would you have handled it?"
- This reveals practical application and relates directly to your kitchen's reality

**Kitchen-Specific Question Adaptations:**

**For Fine Dining Operations:**
