title: How to vacuum pack food properly.
intro: >-
  Vacuum packed cooked foods can have their normal shelf life extended by using
  this method.

  Vacuum packed raw food use by date will not change.

  Vacuum packing food involves the removal of air from packaging that the food
  has been contained in under an airtight seal. However, this process can
  increase the risk to the food from anaerobic organisms, particularly
  clostridium botulinum and listeria monocytogenes, both of which are
  psychrotrophic organisms i.e. Capable of multiplication at low temperatures.

  Consequently, very strict controls must be exercised to avoid contamination,
  multiplication, spore and toxin formation.
