 PPE is really important for keeping everyone safe at work. In the UK, the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 say that employers have to give their staff the right PPE. This means things like safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, safety footwear and more. Employers need to look at the risks in their workplace and choose the PPE that'll give the best protection.

 It's not just about having the PPE though. Employers also have to make sure it fits properly, is well looked after and that staff know how to use it correctly. This is where training comes in. Staff need to understand why the PPE is important and how to wear it right. Plus, the PPE has to be replaced when it gets worn out or damaged.

 In the US, OSHA also has standards for PPE. Their rules say that PPE has to be provided when it's needed to keep staff safe from workplace hazards. Employers have to assess the workplace, choose the right PPE and train their staff on using it properly.

 So whether it's a hard hat on a building site or oven gloves in a kitchen, PPE plays a big part in managing health and safety risks. It's something every business needs to take seriously to keep their staff safe and stay on the right side of the law.

 ## PPE Arrangements

 Through the process of risk assessment, identify personal protective equipment required and ensure that adequate supplies of all necessary protective clothing or equipment are available for issue as required. When issued to employees, a record should be kept to document provision.

 - *Responsible persons should ensure that employees are provided with training, so they know how to safely wear and care for equipment they have been issued with. All training provided by the business should be recorded. Any new starter with the business, before they are set to work, should be equipped with all necessary protective clothing.
- Any person in the workplace, who is observed not wearing protective clothing while carrying out a process which requires the use of protective clothing, should be informed of statutory and company policy requirements and instructed not to continue working until protective clothing is obtained.
- *Responsible persons should ensure that the protective clothing or equipment is suitable for the specific process for which it is provided.&nbsp;
- Arrangements should be made so that personal protective equipment can be maintained, serviced, cleaned, and replaced where necessary and/or appropriate. Facilities should be provided for the storage of PPE where it is necessary to do so.
- The implementation of these safety arrangements should be monitored and reviewed to ensure they remain suitable for the provision of personal protective equipment.
