Step 1: Define Who You're Looking For
Focus on guest service excellence, local knowledge, and problem-solving abilities over technical skills. Separate essential traits (professional communication, service mindset) from nice extras (multiple languages, luxury experience). If you need clarity, check our article on [concierge job descriptions.](https://yourpilla.com/blog/concierge-job-description)

Step 2: Plan the Interview Structure
Choose format based on your property's service level:
- Quick: Short chat plus role-play for immediate coverage
- Standard: Behavioural questions plus guest scenario assessment to test guest service skills
- Extended: Include team interaction for luxury properties or leadership roles

Step 3: Develop Scenario-Based Questions
Ask for specific examples: handling difficult guests, coordinating special requests, managing multiple priorities. Focus on service attitude and problem-solving over perfect local knowledge.

Step 4: Plan Practical Trial Activities
Test guest interaction skills, request coordination, and problem resolution. 45-60 minutes reveals service approach and communication style. Watch for professionalism, initiative, and genuine guest care.

Step 5: Use Consistent Scoring Methods
Weight guest service skills (40%), problem-solving ability (30%), and communication quality (30%). Avoid personality-based hiring. Document specific examples for each score to compare candidates fairly.

## Step 1. Define Who You're Looking For

Concierge roles vary dramatically between properties, so you must understand your specific guest expectations and service standards before interviewing anyone. A luxury hotel concierge faces different challenges than someone supporting a boutique business hotel or private members' club.

**Your goal is to identify the exact combination of service excellence, local knowledge, and problem-solving ability your property needs to exceed guest expectations consistently.**

Use this systematic approach to clarify your requirements:

**1. Analyse Your Property's Service Level and Guest Expectations**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We serve international business travellers requiring restaurant reservations, theatre bookings, and transport coordination / operate a luxury property where guests expect exclusive access and personalised recommendations / manage a boutique hotel where the concierge handles reception duties plus guest services..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What's your guest demographic and typical service requests?
- Do you operate standalone concierge services or combine with reception duties?
- Are you managing day shifts only or 24-hour guest service coverage?
- What's your relationship with local suppliers and service providers?
- Do concierges need to handle VIP guests or special event coordination?

**2. Define Your Property's Service Philosophy and Standards**

Your concierge requirements change based on guest service philosophy and brand positioning:

- "Our property emphasises personalised service, requiring concierges who remember guest preferences and anticipate needs before they're expressed."

- "We operate a fast-paced urban hotel where concierges must efficiently coordinate multiple requests whilst maintaining warm, professional guest relationships."

- "Our luxury establishment values exclusivity, needing concierges who access premium experiences and maintain discretion with high-profile guests."

- "We focus on local authenticity, seeking concierges passionate about the area who can provide insider recommendations and cultural insights."

**3. Establish Priority Balance for Your Property Type**

Different hospitality environments require different skill priorities:

| **Property Type** | **Guest Service Skills** | **Local Knowledge** | **Administrative Skills** | **Relationship Building** |
|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Luxury Hotel | 80% | 60% | 40% | 70% |
| Business Hotel | 70% | 50% | 60% | 40% |
| Boutique Property | 75% | 80% | 50% | 60% |
| Resort/Leisure | 70% | 70% | 30% | 50% |
| Private Club | 60% | 40% | 50% | 80% |

**Enhanced Requirements Framework:**

| **Attribute** | **Must-Have** | **Nice-to-Have** | **Property Type Priority** |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Exceptional guest service mindset | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Professional communication skills | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Problem-solving and initiative | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Discretion and confidentiality | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Basic local area knowledge |  | ✅ | Can be developed through training |
| Multiple language proficiency |  | ✅ | International hotels, specific markets |
| Previous concierge or hospitality experience |  | ✅ | Luxury properties, immediate needs |
| Technology proficiency for booking systems | ✅ |  | Properties with integrated systems |

## Step 3. Develop Scenario-Based Questions

Effective concierge interviews focus on behavioural questions that reveal guest service philosophy, problem-solving approaches, and professional communication skills. Since concierge work requires exceptional service delivery, prioritise service attitude and guest satisfaction over specific local knowledge.

**Your goal is to understand how candidates approach guest service, handle challenges, and maintain professionalism through specific examples from their experience.**

Structure your questions to uncover genuine service patterns and responses to common concierge situations:

- *Follow-up:* "What questions do you have about our guest demographic and service expectations?"

## Step 4. Plan Practical Trial Activities

A well-structured practical trial reveals service approach, problem-solving capability, and professional communication better than any interview conversation. For concierges, the trial should mirror actual guest service situations and test the core skills essential for guest satisfaction.
