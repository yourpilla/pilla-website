## Step 1: Venue Style and Business Introduction

Executive Chefs need to understand the kitchen environment, culinary style, and team ethos. Whether recruiting or redefining a role, include a business overview to guide candidates.

**Convey:**

2. **Culinary style:**

3. **What makes your kitchen unique:**
   - "A collaborative kitchen where chefs participate in menu ideation."
   - "Emphasis on continuous learning and innovation."

 **Tips if you’re unsure how to start:**

- Highlight your team’s atmosphere—high-energy or calm?
- Mention what attracts staff to join or stay.

Authentic descriptions help candidates align their goals with your kitchen’s ethos.

- Self-assessment: Can you describe a time you improved workflow or menu creativity? What was the impact?

 **If defining a new role, gather insights by:**
- Observing how executive chefs manage the kitchen
