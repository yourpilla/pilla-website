title: How to maintain food staff fitness for work.
intro: >-
  The fitness for work policy is to ensure that food handlers do not present any
  health risks to the food itself, if they show or have previously shown signs
  or symptoms of a food borne illness or skin diseases/disorders.

  A convalescent carrier is a person who has suffered from a food borne illness
  and appears to have completely recovered but, is still harboring and excreting
  these pathogenic bacteria, sometimes for a long period after recovery and
  therefore, as a food handler, they still present a significant risk to food
  safety until the point when all pathogenic organisms have been shown to have
  been excreted, usually this is proven by negative stool samples, monitored
  under the auspices of a doctor.

  Occasionally some individuals can harbor pathogenic bacteria internally
  without ever showing any apparent symptoms of a food borne illness, these are
  known as asymptomatic or healthy carriers. Some individuals can also carry
  naturally high levels of pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus on
  their skin and hands, these individuals may unknowingly present a serious risk
  to food safety, hence why only the highest standards of personal hygiene are
  acceptable.

## Before starting work

 Before commencing work, all potential new employees must complete a[ fitness to work questionnaire template](https://yourpilla.com/templates/fitness-to-work-questionnaire) to help eliminate personnel who may not be safe to be working around food. They may be potentially carriers of food borne diseases, both healthy or convalescent. The form should be completed by the manager and the staff member together sat together as a 'Note' on the Pilla weekly planner.

 This form must be completed when returning to work from any gastrointestinal illness any notifiable illness and when having suffered severe skin conditions such as boils on the hands or wrists also infected skin caused by eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis.
