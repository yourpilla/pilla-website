## Step 1: Start with the Service Environment and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 When crafting a job description for new hires, a section outlining your business helps candidates grasp what they're signing up for. This section is just as useful for those revising internal job roles—though you may skip some introductory details, it can remind the reader about the most salient aspects of your establishment.

 **Your aim is to convey:**

- What type of catering service you operate

- What your service style and expectations are

- What working with your team feels like

 Here's a simple three-part guide to follow:

 **1. What type of catering service are you?**

 Begin with a straightforward label: “We’re a corporate catering firm / a wedding service provider / a school lunch supplier / meal prep business...”

 **2. What’s your typical service style?**

 Explain the pacing and interaction style. For example:

- “We serve buffet-style at corporate events, focusing on speed and efficiency.”

- “We provide a sit-down experience at weddings, paying attention to detail and aesthetics.”

- “We prepare and deliver nutritious meals to schools with stringent dietary standards.”

 **3. What differentiates or makes your service appealing?**

 This could be your work culture, unique offerings, or principles. For example:

- “Our team thrives on helping each other in a dynamic work environment.”

- “We use fresh, locally sourced produce for all our meals.”

- “We focus on sustainability, reducing waste, and optimising every part of our service.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you're unsure where to begin, try answering these questions aloud:

- What does a typical event day look like?

- Is the service fast-paced, or do you focus on quality and presentation?

- Do employees engage directly with clients or work behind the scenes?

- Do you have a strong team culture, or is it more individual-focused?

- What do workers frequently find enjoyable about the role?

 Your aim is sincerity, not salesmanship—so be genuine in your description.

 **Example 1: Corporate catering service**

 We're a bustling corporate catering firm based in the city, managing everything from daily office luncheons to large-scale corporate events. Our team is skilled in fast-paced service, ensuring that every guest has the best possible experience. We pride ourselves on presentation and attention to detail.

 **Example 2: Wedding catering company**

 We’re a boutique wedding catering service offering personalised, sit-down meal experiences. Our close-knit team works meticulously to create beautiful dining moments, favouring quality over speed and priding ourselves on creativity and presentation.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Catering Assistant

 Avoid vague descriptions in your job listing. Many lists either use unspecific phrases like "assist with events" or borrow duties from other companies that may not fit your service style.

 **Your goal is to list responsibilities specific to your operation.**

 Make a list of 6–10 bullet points describing what the catering assistant will actually do — not just in theory but in practice.

 Structure the role into three phases of the service. This will make it easier to write and ensure you cover the entire shift:

 **1. Preparation responsibilities**

 These are tasks before service or at the start of the day.

 Consider:

- Who is responsible for prep work?

- What should be ready before an event starts?

 Common examples:

- Prepare cold kitchens by setting up stations with necessary equipment.

- Assist with food prep and work under the guidance of chefs to ensure event menus are complete.

- Gather and check all necessary equipment for events.

 **2. Service responsibilities**

 These are the key tasks during the event or serving time.

 Consider:

- Is the assistant serving guests or assisting in another capacity?

- Do they handle any customer-facing duties?

- Are they responsible for managing food display and replenishment?

 Common examples:

- Assist with the setup of food and beverage tables.

- Ensure timely refilling of buffet stations or trays.

- Maintain cleanliness and orderliness during events.

- Work seamlessly with the kitchen team to coordinate food releases.

 **3. Clean-up and end-of-day tasks**

 These cover what happens once an event concludes or the day ends.

 Consider:

- Who is in charge of breakdown and cleaning?

- Are there specific protocols for disposing of waste or returning equipment?

 Common examples:

- Clean up and break down tables, chairs, and serving areas post-service.

- Ensure waste disposal follows environmental guidelines or business policies.

- Sanitise all workspaces and equipment used during service.

 **If you already have Catering Assistants but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe Them On-the-Job: Watch how they assist in setups, manage service, and clean up after events.

- Request Their Input: Ask for a list of their everyday tasks to capture a well-rounded description.

- Talk with Supervisors: Collaborate with event managers or chefs to gain further insight.

 Useful questions to ask your Catering Assistants:

- What are the main duties you handle at the onset, during, and after an event?

- How do you manage seamless service amidst a busy venue?

- What methods do you use to maintain equipment hygiene and care?

- In what ways do you coordinate and communicate with other team members?

- How often do you provide support or training to newcomers?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Have a current staff member walk you through a typical shift.

- Refer to your schedules or checklists for ideas.

- Consider past operational issues, and make them explicit in the responsibilities section.

 **Example for a corporate event catering service**

 In this role, your responsibilities will encompass:

- Assisting head chefs in food preparation and plating before service.

- Managing the setup and takedown of food stations during events.

- Coordinating with serving staff to ensure quick service during peak times.

- Maintaining excellent hygiene standards at all times.

- Cleaning and resetting areas post-event to ensure readiness for the next setup.

 **Example for a wedding catering business**

 Your key responsibilities will involve:

- Setting up elegant dining stations and supporting chefs in bespoke menu preparations.

- Serving guests courteously and efficiently, ensuring the presentation meets expectations.

- Helping the team restock supplies and troubleshoot during any service hiccups.

- Sanitising equipment and maintaining cleanliness throughout the kitchen area.

- Conducting thorough clean-ups post-service and aiding in wrap-up procedures.

## Step 3: Define What Skills the Person Will Need to Have

 Once the responsibilities are detailed, pinpoint the skills a catering assistant needs to excel in your venue.

 This section aids candidates in evaluating whether they're a fit, and it saves you from sifting through unsuitable applications. As with duties, avoid using generic templates and focus on what's truly applicable to your service.

 **Your goal is to create a list of essential and preferred skills based on your actual needs — not get carried away with ideal but unnecessary requirements.**

 **1. Revisit your responsibilities list**

 Go through each duty and ask yourself:

 “What skill does the assistant need to handle this task effectively?”

 Examples:

- Setting up stations efficiently → time management and organisational skills

- Handling guest questions or complaints → customer service skills

- Assisting chefs in food prep → basic kitchen skills and knife handling

 **2. Divide your list into two categories**

- Must-have skills: Their role can't function without these.

- Nice-to-have skills: These are optional but advantageous and can be taught over time.

 **Example for a comprehensive event service**

 Must-Have Skills

- Proficiency in basic food preparation and equipment handling

- Strong ability in time management during high-stress situations

- Clear, friendly communication skills with clients and team members

- A focus on hygiene standards and safe food handling practices

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Experience working in large-scale or diverse venue setups

- Ability to adapt quickly and take initiative when unexpected issues arise

- Prior experience with dietary restrictions and special menus

## Step 4: Defining How Much Experience Is Required

 Now that you’ve laid out the essential skills, it’s important to elucidate how much hands-on experience is required for the role. Being explicit about this can help in avoiding misalignments and ensuring candidates know if they meet the expectations.

 Nonetheless, steer clear of asking for more experience than truly necessary. It could deter excellent, trainable prospects from applying.

 **Your aim is to specify the nature of experience needed — rather than simply counting years, focus on familiarity with specific service environments.**

 **1. Determine if this is an entry-level, intermediate, or senior role**

- Beginner: Open to those without tailored catering experience but who are eager to learn.

- Intermediate: Requires solid experience in a comparable catering setup.

- Advanced: Needs comprehensive experience with event management or leadership in catering staff.

 Don't wrongly label the role as senior just to attract reliability — this leads to mismatches in expectations and compensation.

 **2. Focus on the type of experience, not just the time**

 Rather than stating “2 years’ experience,” clarify the kind of work environment you’re referring to. Ask yourself:

- Does the role involve familiarity with large-scale event management?

- Is experience required in managing dietary restrictions or unique gourmet requirements?

- Does familiarity with particular service styles (like buffet versus plated meals) make a difference?

 Clarify expectations — someone with 1 year managing a school kitchen might be more suited than another with 3 years of fast-food experience.

 **3. Specify whether training is provided or necessary**

 If your team offers comprehensive training, highlight it. Otherwise, if the expectation is to start operating immediately with little trial, clarify that.

 **Example for a mid-level catering assistant**

 "We're seeking a candidate with at least a year of experience in a bustling catering service. Confidence in prepping food, assisting chefs, and managing stations is required. Training will be part of your journey with us, but a solid foundation is expected from day one."

 **Example where training is available**

 "No professional experience needed; all you need is a keen interest in catering and an eagerness to learn. We offer on-the-job training adapting you fully into our service standards and venue operations."

 **Example for a senior assistant role**

 "You must show at least 18 months of refined experience in catering environments renowned for high standards. You should be competent in supervising station setups, liaising with clients, and handling tight schedules. Participation in mentor training is favourable."

## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 Although capabilities are essential, matching personalities with your culture ensures that individuals become valuable, long-standing team members. This section encourages the right fit for both your team and your venue.

 Avoid clichés like “must be a team player”—that doesn’t narrate what the right personality should look like.

 **Your task is to describe the working style, energy, and communication habits that are conducive to your team and service model.**

 **1. Reflect on existing dynamics within your team**

 Consider:

- What traits do your top performers commonly embody?

- Are there particular styles or energies that struggle in your environment?

- Is the team dynamic lively and fastidious or serene and detail-oriented?

- Is guest interaction vibrant and extensive, or efficient and brisk?

 Write the key traits or modes of working you foresee succeeding.

 **2. Aim for specifics over generalities**

 Instead of using phrases like “team player,” demonstrate what that signifies. For instance:

- “Proactively tackles setup or breakdown tasks when everyone's busy”

- “Communicates clearly within rapid-paced setups”

- “Engages and assists clients with event requirements and inquiries”

 **3. Align personality with job pressure levels**

- If catering is large-scale and demanding: Pick someone organised under pressure and adept at prioritisation.

- If the venue is more intimate and guest-centred: Look for empathetic, observant individuals who enjoy interaction.

 **Example for a high-tempo service**

 "You're a great fit if you stay collected amidst chaos, act decisively, and focus on quality rather than shortcomings. Our team relies on close, proactive communication, so someone who relishes the dynamics of a bustling environment will flourish here."

 **Example for a laid-back service**

 "This role is perfect for someone personable, patient, and attentive who delights in guest interaction. Operating in our team means taking pride in modest tasks, offering support to colleagues, and sparking positivity in each duty. An enthusiasm for catering and client satisfaction will invariably be an edge."

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Consult your staff: “Who thrives here and what qualities do they exhibit?”

- Reflect on past hires that didn’t work out—what was missing?

- Be sincere. If the environment is challenging, admit the need for someone who maintains their composure and diligence rather than pretence for multifarious talents.

## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 Being upfront about pay and benefits is crucial for drawing in candidates who align with your expectations, and creating a positive starting point in negotiations.

 Openness about these aspects shows candidates you value their time and pre-emptively aligns expectations.

 **Clearly outline:**

- The rate of pay—hourly or salaried

- All benefits or additional perks offered

- Key characteristics that make working in your venue unique

 **1. Be precise about pay—whether hourly or salaried**

 List the exact or anticipated range. Uncertainty as to what to offer? Consider:

- What do comparable venues in your region pay? (research Indeed, Caterer, or local job boards)

- What are your expectations — are you seeking a trainee, mid-level, or senior position?

- If pay depends on experience, mention it with a general range

 Example:

  £10.50–£11.50 per hour based on experience
£11.00/hour + tips, with performance reviews every quarter Avoid phrases like “competitive pay”—lack of specifics is wearying for candidates.

 **2. Outline any additional staff benefits**

 Even small incentives can resonate. Think beyond wages:

- Reduced or free meals, beverage discounts

- Breaks and paid training times

- Tips or bonus structures

- Team-building events or social gatherings

- Mental wellbeing programs or health support initiatives

- Fixed working hours or adaptable shift availability

- Paid leave, particularly if it surpasses statutory minimums

 Example:

- Free meals and refreshments during shifts

- Paid leave inclusive of bank holidays

- Regular team sessions and celebratory events

- Equitable division of tips across the team

- Venue shuts for a fortnight over the festive period

 **3. Highlight progression opportunities (if possessed)**

 If prospects for structured learning, mentorship, or roles of increased responsibility exist, make them visible.

 Example:

 We commit to advancing your skills with on-site guidance, opportunities for external catering certifications, and prospects for elevating roles into supervisory or managerial capacities.

 **Sample section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £10.50–£11.50 per hour subject to skillsetTips: Evenly spaced across the colleagues (averaging £1–2/hr)
Benefits: 
- Complimentary drinks and meals on shifts

- A 28-day paid holiday scheme (inclusive of bank holidays)

- Legal and skill-focused training modules available

- Shared tips through transparent point systems

- Limited operations time—services close at 5pm

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask yourself: “What aspects entice longevity in this role?”

- Be transparent—it’s best to communicate limitations than promise excessively

- If compensation is lower, stress other appealing aspects of the job (flexible schedules, team culture, professional growth, etc.)
