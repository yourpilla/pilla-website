 Slips, trips and falls are some of the most common causes of accidents and injuries at work, especially in the hospitality industry. In the UK, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 says employers must do what's reasonably possible to protect workers and others from harm. This means looking at the risks of slips and trips and putting sensible measures in place to control them.

 The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 also apply. They say you must assess risks (including slip and trip risks) and take action to address them where needed.

 In the US, slips, trips, and falls come under OSHA's general requirements for walking and working surfaces (29 CFR 1910 Subpart D). This standard says that all workplaces should be kept clean, orderly, and sanitary. It also has rules about things like housekeeping, lighting, and guarding floor and wall openings to cut the risk of accidents.

 So, to keep both staff and customers safe, it's essential for hospitality businesses to manage slips and trips as part of their health and safety arrangements. This means understanding the risks, taking practical steps to prevent accidents, and making sure everyone knows how to work safely and spot potential hazards.

 ## Slips, trips and falls arrangements

 - Responsible Persons should raise awareness amongst staff about keeping walkways clear and areas clean and tidy.
- Provide training to staff on the importance of good housekeeping. Document all training provided.
- Identify senior team members who will be responsible for monitoring and improving safe pedestrian movement around the venue.
- Identify through assessment of risk all the potential causes of slips, trips, and falls.
- Develop and implement procedures and control measures.
- Ensure that floor surfaces are fit for the purpose, that they are routinely maintained and checked.
- Ensure that any risk assessments or safety inspections are carried out by competent and trained personnel.
- Monitor and review your arrangements to ensure that you have in place sufficient protocols to control the potential risk of slips, trips, and falls.
