# How to Set Up Legionella Temperature Testing Checks

 ## TLDR: About Legionella Water Temperature Checks

 - Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious lung infection called Legionnaires' disease. It's usually caught by breathing in tiny droplets of water that contain the bacteria. Legionella can grow in hot and cold water systems, so it's a risk you need to manage carefully in your business.
- As&nbsp;an employer or someone in control of a premises,  it's your job to understand and manage legionella risks. You need to consider whether legionella bacteria could grow in your water systems and, if so, put in place measures to either prevent it or control the risks.
- One of the things that you should do is a weekly water temperature test. This test makes sure that your water is not operating inside the danger zone temperature of 20°C - 50°C. You should test two locations per week.
- Pilla has a pre-built water temperature check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff to record compliant checks.

  ## Preparing for Water Temperature Checks

 Before checking your water temperature, it’s important to prepare both the equipment and the environment.&nbsp;

 Start by choosing a suitable thermometer. Infrared models can give you a quick reading, but a probe thermometer gives the most reliable result when testing running water or stored hot water tanks.

 Here’s how to prepare:

 Check your thermometer is clean and calibrated. If it hasn’t been calibrated recently, run a quick ice water or boiling water test first.
Clean and disinfect the probe using warm soapy water, followed by a rinse and alcohol wipe. This prevents cross-contamination between taps or outlets.
Choose the right outlet. If your check is part of a routine legionella prevention plan, this may include outlets like taps, showers, or hot water cylinders. Each outlet should be checked in line with your risk assessment schedule.

 Just like with food probes, preparation matters. A dirty thermometer or poorly chosen test point can lead to misleading results.

 ## Hot Water Temperature Checks

 This test confirms whether your hot water system is heating to a safe minimum temperature of at least 50°C&nbsp;

 Here’s how to do it:

 Run the hot tap for at least one minute. This ensures you’re testing water from the system, not what’s been sitting in the pipe.
Insert the probe into the water stream or collect the water in a clean container for testing.
Take the temperature reading once stabilised. The thermometer should sit at a steady reading for at least ten seconds.
Record the result in your Water Temperature Check in Pilla.

 If temperatures are below this, investigate the cause. It could be a fault in your boiler, thermostat, or circulation system—or simply a tap that doesn’t get used often.

 ## Cold Water Temperature Checks

 Cold outlets should deliver water cool enough to prevent bacterial growth. That means below 20°C after running for two minutes, especially if the water is stored in tanks or used in food prep areas.

 Here’s how to carry out the check:

 Run the cold tap for two full minutes. This flushes standing water and allows a true reading from the mains or tank supply.
Place the probe into the water stream or collect a sample in a clean jug.
Wait until the reading stabilises and record the temperature.
