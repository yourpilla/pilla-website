title: How to Set Up Legionella Temperature Testing Checks
tldr: >-
  - Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious lung infection
  called Legionnaires' disease. It's usually caught by breathing in tiny
  droplets of water that contain the bacteria. Legionella can grow in hot and
  cold water systems, so it's a risk you need to manage carefully in your
  business.

  - As&nbsp;an employer or someone in control of a premises,  it's your job to
  understand and manage legionella risks. You need to consider whether
  legionella bacteria could grow in your water systems and, if so, put in place
  measures to either prevent it or control the risks.

  - One of the things that you should do is a weekly water temperature test.
  This test makes sure that your water is not operating inside the danger zone
  temperature of 20°C - 50°C. You should test two locations per week.

  - Pilla has a pre-built water temperature check inside which includes all of
  the inputs for staff to record compliant checks.
