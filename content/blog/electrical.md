 Electrical safety is a big deal for any business, but it's especially important in hospitality. That's because there's a lot of electrical equipment being used all the time - from kitchen appliances to lighting and power systems.

 In the UK, there are laws that tell us how to keep electrical systems safe at work. The main one is the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. It's all about managing the risks that come with using electricity. So, if you're running a hotel, restaurant, or any other hospitality business, you need to make sure you're following these rules.

 It's not just about keeping your staff safe either. Your customers and visitors need to be protected too. Nobody wants an accident to happen because of a faulty wire or a dodgy plug socket.

 The regulations cover all sorts of things - from making sure equipment is installed properly to keeping it well-maintained. You need to have systems in place to check for any problems and fix them quickly. Plus, your staff need to know how to use electrical equipment safely. Training is key here.

 But it's not just a UK thing. In the US, there are similar rules set out by OSHA. They've got standards that cover electrical safety in the workplace too. So, whether you're based in London or Los Angeles, you need to be on top of this stuff.

 At the end of the day, electrical safety is about more than just following the law. It's about protecting your people and your business. By including it in your health and safety management system, you're showing that you take it seriously. And that's good news for everyone.

 ## Electrical Arrangements

 Electricity can kill or severely injure people and cause damage to property. Your company has a duty to take precautions when working with or near electricity and electrical equipment to significantly reduce the risk of injury to your employees and others who may be harmed by your working practices.

 - Responsible Persons should conduct a risk assessment of any electrical hazards, which covers who could be harmed by them, how the level of risk has been established, and the precautions taken to control that risk.
- Ensure that the electrical installation and the electrical equipment are suitable for their intended use, the conditions in which they are operated, and are only used for their intended purpose.
- Provide training to staff to make them aware of the risk associated with the use of electrical appliances and instruction on how to check appliances prior to use.
- Ensure electrical appliances are checked prior to use. Remove equipment where:the plug or connector is damaged,the cable has been repaired with tape, is not secure, or internal wires are visible, etc.,burn marks or stains are present (suggesting overheating).
- the plug or connector is damaged,
- the cable has been repaired with tape, is not secure, or internal wires are visible, etc.,
- burn marks or stains are present (suggesting overheating).
- Identify a suitable frequency for electrical appliances to be tested based on equipment in use and HSE guidance (Maintaining portable electrical equipment in low-risk environments) and put protocols in place to ensure they are tested at the designated frequency.
- Electrical equipment must be tested by a competent person - a competent person is someone who has the suitable training, skill, and knowledge for the task to be undertaken to prevent injury to themselves and others.
- Provide an adequate amount of plug points to reduce the requirement for extension leads, as they pose a danger of overheating and can become a trip hazard within the venue.
- Ensure all electrical installation work (including repairs) is undertaken by a competent, qualified Electrical Engineer.
- Arrange for a periodic inspection of the fixed hard wiring at the frequency identified by an Electrical Engineer (usually 5 years) – this work must be undertaken by an Electrical Engineer accredited to NICEIC.
- Ensure resulting documentation issued (Electrical Condition Report) following the periodic inspection of the fixed hard wiring is reviewed and filed in your company's safety file.
- Monitor the use of electrical equipment and address any reported hazards where electrical safety is compromised.
