  Step 1: Define Who You're Looking For
  Focus on leadership ability, kitchen management skills, and service pressure handling over just cooking ability. Separate essential traits (team management, operational thinking) from nice extras (menu development, cost control). If you need clarity, check our article on [sous chef job descriptions.](https://yourpilla.com/blog/sous-chef-job-description)

  Step 2: Plan the Interview Structure
  Choose format based on kitchen size and responsibility level:
  - Standard: Behavioural questions plus scenario-based challenges for most sous chef roles
  - Extended: Include practical management tasks and team interaction for senior positions
  - Comprehensive: Add pre-interview assignments for head chef development track

  Step 3: Develop Leadership and Scenario-Based Questions
  Ask for specific examples: managing service crises, training junior staff, improving kitchen systems. Focus on problem-solving approach and team development over technical perfection.

  Step 4: Plan Management Trial Activities
  Test decision-making, staff coordination, and pressure handling. 60-90 minutes reveals leadership style and operational thinking. Watch for calm authority, clear communication, and guest-focused solutions.

  Step 5: Use Consistent Scoring Methods
  - Leadership and team management (40%)
  - Service pressure handling (30%)
  - Organisation skills (30%). 
  Avoid personality-based hiring. Document specific examples for each score to compare candidates fairly.

## Step 1. Define Who You're Looking For

Sous chef roles vary significantly between kitchen environments, so you must understand your specific operational needs and leadership expectations before interviewing anyone. A sous chef in a high-volume restaurant faces different challenges than someone supporting a fine dining establishment or hotel operation.

**Your goal is to identify the exact combination of leadership ability, kitchen management skills, and operational thinking your establishment needs to support the head chef and maintain service excellence.**

Use this systematic approach to clarify your requirements:

**1. Analyse Your Kitchen's Leadership Needs and Structure**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We need a sous chef who can independently run service when the head chef is absent / require someone who can manage a 12-person brigade during 300-cover services / need a leader who can develop junior staff whilst maintaining exacting standards..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What's the size and complexity of your kitchen brigade?
- How often does the sous chef need to run service independently?
- Are you operating multiple service periods or complex event operations?
- What's your staff turnover and training requirements?
- Do you need menu development and cost control involvement?

**2. Define Your Kitchen's Leadership Philosophy and Standards**

Your sous chef requirements change based on operational philosophy and team development needs:

- "Our fast-paced kitchen requires a sous chef who can maintain calm authority during service pressure whilst developing junior staff through clear communication and structured training."

- "We operate a fine dining establishment where the sous chef must uphold exacting standards whilst fostering creativity and technical development in our culinary team."

- "Our hotel operation values consistency and coordination, needing a sous chef who can manage multiple outlets whilst ensuring seamless service delivery across varied dining experiences."

- "We focus on sustainable growth, seeking a sous chef who can systematically improve kitchen operations whilst mentoring staff for advancement within our organisation."

**3. Establish Priority Balance for Your Kitchen Type**

Different kitchen environments require different leadership priorities:

| **Kitchen Type** | **Leadership Skills** | **Technical Ability** | **Operational Management** | **Staff Development** |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| High-Volume Restaurant | 85% | 70% | 90% | 75% |
| Fine Dining | 80% | 95% | 80% | 85% |
| Hotel Multi-Outlet | 90% | 75% | 95% | 80% |
| Event/Banquet | 85% | 70% | 95% | 70% |
| Gastropub/Casual Fine | 80% | 80% | 85% | 80% |

**Enhanced Requirements Framework:**

| **Attribute** | **Must-Have** | **Nice-to-Have** | **Kitchen Type Priority** |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Team leadership and management ability | ✅ |  | All kitchen operations |
| Service pressure handling and crisis management | ✅ |  | All kitchen operations |
| Kitchen organisation and operational planning | ✅ |  | All kitchen operations |
| Staff training and development capability | ✅ |  | All kitchen operations |
| Advanced culinary technique and creativity |  | ✅ | Fine dining, innovative establishments |
| Menu development and costing experience |  | ✅ | Independent operations, senior roles |
| Multi-outlet or event management experience |  | ✅ | Hotels, catering operations |
| Financial management and cost control | ✅ |  | Independent restaurants, senior positions |
| Health and safety leadership | ✅ |  | All kitchen operations |

**4. Consider Your Development and Succession Planning**

Your hiring requirements depend on long-term kitchen goals:

**Operational Stability Focus:**

**5. Kitchen-Specific Context and Leadership Expectations**

Your specific operational context shapes requirements:

**Service Leadership Demands:**
- Peak service periods requiring calm crisis management and staff coordination
- Complex menu execution needing technical oversight and quality control
- Multi-station coordination requiring clear communication and timing management

## Step 3. Develop Leadership and Scenario-Based Questions

Effective sous chef interviews focus on behavioural questions that reveal leadership capability, operational thinking, and staff management skills. Since sous chef work requires exceptional leadership under pressure, prioritise management attitude and problem-solving approach over perfect technical knowledge.

**Your goal is to understand how candidates approach kitchen leadership, handle management challenges, and develop teams through specific examples from their experience.**

Structure your questions to uncover genuine leadership patterns and responses to common sous chef management situations:

**1. Building Effective Leadership Questions**

Sous chef questions should focus on core competencies: team leadership, crisis management, operational thinking, staff development, and strategic support.

**Question Structure Framework:**

- *Assessment focus:* Research into operation, alignment with kitchen philosophy, strategic thinking
- *Follow-up:* "What questions do you have about our service style, team structure, and operational expectations?"

## Step 4. Plan Management Trial Activities
