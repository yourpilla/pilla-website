  Sous vide is French for ‘under vacuum’ and describes a method of cooking in
  vacuum sealed plastic pouches at low temperatures for long periods. Sous vide
  cooking differs from conventional cooking methods as the raw food is vacuum
  sealed in a plastic bag and the food is cooked using more precise temperature
  control.
