 ## Choosing and writing your own kitchen opening and closing checklists

 When things get busy, good habits are often the first to go and that's why clear, well-written opening and closing checks are important - they make it easy for your team to stay consistent, no matter who’s on shift and how buy it gets.

 If you treat these checks with lot of respect and make sure everybody values them then they will become one of your most important tools for catching issues early and maintaining food safety and brand standards.

 In this guide, you’ll learn how to write your own kitchen opening and closing checklists in a way that works for your team. You’ll follow six practical steps, with examples for both opening and closing routines.

 Let’s get started.

 ## Step 1: Walk through your kitchen&nbsp;

 The goal is to identify the tasks that make the kitchen safe, clean, and ready - either to begin service or to shut down properly.

 Before writing your checklist, do two walkthroughs: one before opening, and one after closing. These walkthroughs help you observe the kitchen like a health inspector, not a busy chef. You’ll pick up on small but critical issues that your team might overlook when under pressure.

 **For Opening: See the kitchen with fresh eyes**

 Your goal is to make sure the kitchen is clean, stocked, and fully operational before prep starts.&nbsp;

 **Start where your team starts - usually the delivery area or dry store.**

 - Are deliveries from yesterday recorded and put away correctly?&nbsp;
- Is the fridge space cleared for today’s orders?&nbsp;
- Are new deliveries being checked for temperature and use-by dates?
- Are deliveries from yesterday recorded and put away correctly?
- Is the fridge space cleared for today’s orders?
- Are new deliveries being checked for temperature and use-by date**

 Move into food storage areas:**

 - Are all items labelled, dated, and stored off the floor?&nbsp;
- Is there any food from yesterday that should have been discarded?&nbsp;
- Can staff reach what they need without risk of cross-contamination?
- Are all items labelled, dated, and stored off the floor?
- Is there any food from yesterday that should have been discarded?
- Can staff reach what they need without risk of cross-contamination?

 **Check prep areas and surfaces:**

 - Are chopping boards, utensils, and knives clean, dry, and disinfected?&nbsp;
- Has sanitiser been made up correctly, and are bottles full and clearly labelled?&nbsp;
- Are the cloths fresh or reused? (Reused cloths should be avoided for food contact surfaces.)
- Are chopping boards, utensils, and knives clean, dry, and disinfected?
- Has sanitiser been made up correctly, and are bottles full and clearly labelled?
- Are the cloths fresh or reused? (Reused cloths should be avoided for food contact surfaces.)

 **Inspect hand wash stations:**

 - Are there full soap and paper towel dispensers?&nbsp;
- Is there hot running water?&nbsp;
- Is the bin for hand towel waste clean and not overflowing?
- Are there full soap and paper towel dispensers?
- Is there hot running water?
- Is the bin for hand towel waste clean and not overflowing?

 **Finish at equipment and ventilation:**

 - Are fridges holding correct temperatures?&nbsp;
- Is the extraction fan on and working?&nbsp;
- Is any specialist equipment (vac pack, water bath) clean, calibrated, and ready?
- Are fridges holding correct temperatures?
- Is the extraction fan on and working?
- Is any specialist equipment (vac pack, water bath) clean, calibrated, and ready?

 **For Closing: Think like tomorrow’s shift — or an EHO walking in at 7am**

 The kitchen should be left clean, pest-proof, and ready for a safe restart in the morning.

 **Begin at the pass and work backwards**

 - Are all foods from service put away safely? (Nothing left out or cooling uncovered.)&nbsp;
- Has everything been labelled and dated?&nbsp;
- Are there any dishes that need discarding instead of storing?
- Are all foods from service put away safely? (Nothing left out or cooling uncovered.)
- Has everything been labelled and dated?
- Are there any dishes that need discarding instead of storing?

 **Move into the prep area:**

 - Have surfaces, boards, and tools been properly disinfected?&nbsp;
- Are cleaning cloths stored in sanitiser or disposed of?&nbsp;
- Is the sanitiser bottle full for the morning shift?
- Have surfaces, boards, and tools been properly disinfected?
- Are cleaning cloths stored in sanitiser or disposed of?
- Is the sanitiser bottle full for the morning shift?

 **Check storage:**

 - Are raw and ready-to-eat items stored separately?&nbsp;
- Is defrosting food placed in a tray at the bottom of the fridge?&nbsp;
- Is anything leaking, uncovered, or starting to spoil?
- Are raw and ready-to-eat items stored separately?
- Is defrosting food placed in a tray at the bottom of the fridge?
- Is anything leaking, uncovered, or starting to spoil?

 **Review equipment:**

 - Has all equipment been turned off, wiped down, and allowed to cool?&nbsp;
- Are the fridge doors closed properly? (Some staff leave them ajar by accident.)&nbsp;
- Is the extraction system turned off?
- Has all equipment been turned off, wiped down, and allowed to cool?
- Are the fridge doors closed properly? (Some staff leave them ajar by accident.)
- Is the extraction system turned off?
- Check waste areas: Have bins been emptied and cleaned? Are fresh liners in place? Are external waste stores locked and tidy to prevent pest activity?
- Have bins been emptied and cleaned?
- Are fresh liners in place?
- Are external waste stores locked and tidy to prevent pest activity?

 **Finish at cleaning supplies:**

 - Are soap, sanitiser, and blue roll topped up for the morning?&nbsp;
- Are all cleaning tools (mops, buckets, sprays) clean and stored off the floor?
- Are soap, sanitiser, and blue roll topped up for the morning?
- Are all cleaning tools (mops, buckets, sprays) clean and stored off the floor?

 Tip: Take photos during your walkthrough — one of a perfectly clean section, and one of a poorly closed area. Use these as examples during team training.

 ## Step 2: Break your checklist into working zones

 The goal is to structure your checks around how the kitchen actually functions so the checklist flows naturally and nothing important is missed.

 Great checklists are easy to follow because they are in a useful order. The best way to do this is to organise tasks by kitchen zone or activity type, matching the physical layout of the kitchen and the routine your team follows.

 By grouping related tasks together, you reduce mental load and stop people skipping steps. The list becomes faster to complete and easier to delegate.

 **For Opening Checks: Build the checklist in the order your team prepares the kitchen**

 Start from the moment a team member walks in, and follow the real path they take to get set up for service.

 Here’s a structure with practical examples:

 1. Deliveries and Storage AreasTasks here ensure stock is safe, traceable, and ready for use. - Have deliveries been accepted, temperature-checked, recorded, and labelled?
- Are fridges and freezers running at the correct temperatures?
- Are new deliveries stored in the right place (e.g. raw meat at the bottom, cooked food above)?
- Are dry goods off the floor and within date?

 Why it matters: Most food safety issues start at the point of delivery. If chilled goods sit in the corridor or aren’t labelled, they become a blind spot in your safety system.

 2. Food Prep Surfaces and Equipment
Checks here focus on hygiene and readiness before any food handling begins. - Are all prep surfaces cleaned and sanitised before use?
- Are knives, chopping boards, mixers, and blenders clean and ready?
- Are cloths fresh or single-use, not reused from yesterday?
- Is the dishwasher or glasswasher clean, descaled, and filled with detergent?

 Why it matters: Cross-contamination risks are highest during setup — especially when people assume “it was probably cleaned last night.”

 3. Handwashing and Staff Hygiene
Checks here protect food from staff-borne contamination. - Do all hand wash stations have hot water, soap, and paper towels or hand dryers?
- Are sinks clean, unblocked, and accessible — not full of equipment?
- Are staff in clean uniforms with hair tied back and no signs of illness?

 Why it matters: The first thing a chef should do is wash their hands. If the station isn’t clean and functional, that first defence is gone.

 4. Equipment and Services
Make sure all critical kit is working before prep begins. - Are fridges, ovens, hobs, and extraction fans working correctly?
- Are temperature probes clean and calibrated?
- Are lights working in all prep areas and storage spaces?

 Why it matters: Equipment failure in the middle of service is a common reason for food waste, delays, and complaints.

 5. Cleaning Tools and Chemicals
Stocking up before service avoids delays later. - Are sanitiser bottles full, labelled, and made up to the correct dilution?
- Are mop buckets and cloths clean and stored hygienically?
- Are waste bins lined, empty, and positioned correctly?

 Why it matters: Teams are more likely to clean as they go if everything they need is available and ready.

 **For Closing Checks: Reverse the process - clean and shut down each zone methodically**

 The goal of closing checks is to leave the kitchen hygienic, pest-safe, and fully reset for the next shift. Here’s how to structure the checklist:

 **1. Cookline and Prep Areas**

 - Are all used foods either discarded or labelled and stored correctly?
- Are hot-holding units emptied and cleaned?
- Have all surfaces and utensils been washed, sanitised, and air dried?

 Why it matters: Food left out, or tools half-cleaned, creates risk overnight — and can become a breeding ground for bacteria.

 **2. Fridges, Freezers, and Storage**

 - Are all foods covered, dated, and rotated?
- Are defrosting or cooling items stored safely in trays on the bottom shelf?
- Are no-risk leftovers being discarded rather than stored unnecessarily?

 Why it matters: Fridge storage is one of the most common issues picked up in inspections, especially overnight cooling practices.

 **3. Equipment and Services**

 - Have all cooking appliances been switched off and cleaned (including grill trays, filters, combi ovens)?
- Is extraction turned off and grease filters wiped down if required?
- Are fridge doors closed and seals wiped?

 Why it matters: Leaving things on overnight increases the risk of fire, damage, or spoilage — and wastes energy.

 **4. Waste and Pest Prevention**

 - Have all bins been emptied, cleaned, and relined?
- Is waste stored outside with lids shut and access secured?
- Are no food scraps left behind under counters or in floor drains?

 Why it matters: Pests don’t take days off — they’ll find whatever’s left out, especially in warmer months.

 **5. Re-Stocking for the Next Shift**

 - Are soap, sanitiser, and blue roll stocked and ready?
- Is the dishwasher cleaned, filters removed, and left open to air?
- Are mop heads washed or changed?

 Why it matters: A good close makes for a smooth open. The next team can focus on food, not fixing yesterday’s mistakes.

 ## Step 3: Focus on what can go wrong

 Many checklist item exist for one reason - to stop a real risk from becoming a real problem.

 It’s easy to fall into the trap of writing a long list of generic tasks that feel good on paper but don’t actually protect the business. Instead, every item on your checklist should act as a barrier to a common failure - whether that’s food poisoning, pest infestation, contamination, allergic reaction, equipment breakdown or something more operational like forgetting to clock in or not ordering stock.

 So before you add a check to your checklist, ask:
“What could go wrong if this doesn’t get done?” **For Opening Checks: Think about what could ruin the day before it even begins**

 Each check should stop your team walking into service blind. Examples:

 Risk: Unsafe food gets used in prep
Checklist item: “Check deliveries have been accepted, temperature-checked, and labelled.”
 Why it matters: If staff miss a delivery or forget to temperature-check it, unsafe food could go straight into storage — and onto the customer’s plate.

 Risk: Dirty prep surfaces lead to cross-contamination
Checklist item: “Sanitise food prep surfaces and check sanitiser solution is correctly made up.”
 Why it matters: Disinfectant only works if it’s used properly. An empty bottle or wrong dilution means surfaces aren’t safe — and you might not know until it’s too late.

 Risk: Staff illness spreads to food
Checklist item: “Confirm all staff are fit for work and have no symptoms of illness.”
 Why it matters: Under food safety law, staff with vomiting, diarrhoea, or symptoms of infection must not handle food. A simple verbal check at the start of shift protects everyone.

 Risk: No soap or towels leads to poor hand hygiene
Checklist item: “Handwash stations fully stocked with hot water, soap, and towels.”
 Why it matters: This is your first line of defence. If soap’s missing or the sink’s blocked, it only takes one person to cut corners.

 **For Closing Checks: Focus on what might happen overnight**

 Think of closing checks as locking the door not just on the building - but on all food safety risks.

 Risk: Pests are attracted by leftover food
Checklist item: “Remove waste, clean bins, and ensure external storage is shut.”
 Why it matters: A single missed bin liner or spilled food tray can attract flies, mice, or cockroaches overnight. And once they’re in, they’re hard to get out.

 Risk: Equipment left on could cause fire or damage
Checklist item: “Switch off ovens, grills, and extraction fans.”
 Why it matters: Leaving kit running is a serious fire risk — and could burn out expensive appliances unnecessarily.

 Risk: Cooling or defrosting food spoils
Checklist item: “Check all cooling/defrosting items are covered, dated, and stored safely in bottom shelf trays.”
 Why it matters: Warm or uncovered food left to cool overnight can become a breeding ground for bacteria — and spoilage won’t always be obvious until it’s too late.

 Risk: No sanitiser or blue roll for the next shift
Checklist item: “Check cleaning materials are stocked for the morning.”
 Why it matters: If the morning team has to waste time chasing supplies, cleaning standards drop — or things get missed entirely.

 Practical tip:
For every item on your checklist, write a short internal note or comment in your system that answers:
“What does this prevent?”
It helps with team training and gives you clarity on why each task is included. ## Step 4: Write every task clearly, completely, and with zero room for guesswork

 The goal is to make each checklist item so clear that anybody - including a new starter on their first day - can complete it confidently, without asking for help or making assumptions.

 Your checklist is not a reminder for experienced managers. It’s a tool for busy teams, often working under pressure, across different shifts, with different levels of training and attention to detail.

 The clearer the task, the more consistently it will be done — and the easier it is to hold people accountable.

 - **Checklist items should tell the reader three things:**

 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1

 If it only includes point 1, it’s probably too vague. If it includes point 2, it’s usable but somebody might skip it. If you can also build in point 3 during training, it helps the team understand the purpose and they will engage more with the task.

 **Opening Checklist: Clear task writing examples**

 ❌ Vague: “Check fridges”

 - Check for what? Temperature? Cleanliness? Stocking? It’s unclear.

 ✅ Clear: “Check all fridges are below 5°C and record temperatures on log sheet”

 - Includes what, how, and a required outcome (logged proof).

 ❌ Vague: “Sanitiser ready”

 - Ready where? In what form? How much?

 ✅ Clear: “Ensure spray bottles are full, labelled, and made up using correct dilution for food contact surfaces”

 - Avoids team using water or an unknown mix. Helps maintain chemical safety too.

 ❌ Vague: “Hand wash basin clean”

 - No detail on what to check.

 ✅ Clear: “Hand wash sink clean and unblocked, with hot water, soap and disposable towels available”

 - Covers cleanliness, function, and required supplies.

 ❌ Vague: “Staff ready”

 - Doesn’t help shift leader know what to look for.

 ✅ Clear: “All staff in clean uniform, with hair tied back and no symptoms of illness (e.g. diarrhoea, vomiting, sore throat)”

 - Ties directly to food hygiene law (staff must be excluded if unwell).

 ❌ Vague: “Check food storage”

 - No specifics.

 ✅ Clear: “Check all food in fridges is covered, labelled, and in date; raw foods stored below cooked and ready-to-eat items”

 - Includes what to check and the correct order of storage.

 **Closing Checklist: Clear task writing examples**

 ❌ Vague: “Clean surfaces”

 - Doesn’t explain how or what to use.

 ✅ Clear: “Clean and disinfect all prep surfaces using food-safe sanitiser. Leave for full contact time, then air dry.”

 - Ensures proper chemical use and drying — both legally required.

 ❌ Vague: “Put away leftovers”

 - Leaves too much room for unsafe storage.

 ✅ Clear: “Label and date all leftover food; store covered in suitable containers on correct fridge shelves”

 - Promotes stock rotation and avoids contamination.

 ❌ Vague: “Bins emptied”

 - Doesn’t check hygiene or readiness for next shift.

 ✅ Clear: “Empty all bins, clean internal and external surfaces, and reline with fresh bags”

 - Prevents overnight pest issues and leaves area ready.

 ❌ Vague: “Equipment cleaned”

 - Doesn’t say what equipment or how thoroughly.

 ✅ Clear: “Switch off all cooking equipment. Wipe down surfaces, clean grills/trays, and soak removable parts as needed”

 - Avoids half-done cleaning or safety risks from hot kit left on.

 ❌ Vague: “Restock cleaning supplies”

 - What supplies? How much?

 ✅ Clear: “Top up soap, sanitiser, and paper towels at all stations. Check spare stock is available for morning shift.”

 - Keeps morning team running smoothly — avoids excuses.

 **Start with a strong verb:&nbsp;**Use command-based verbs that tell the reader exactly what to do. Examples:

 - Check, Clean, Label, Discard, Store, Switch off, Top up, Record, Remove

 Avoid vague or passive phrases like:

 - Make sure, Ensure everything’s okay, Confirm, Tidy

 **Set clear standards or outcomes:&nbsp;**Wherever possible, include measurable expectations.

 - Instead of “Check fridge is cold” → “Fridge should be below 5°C”
- Instead of “Store food correctly” → “Raw meat stored at bottom of fridge; all items covered and dated”

 This helps teams know what success looks like — and helps managers spot when things are done incorrectly.

 **Be consistent across all checklists:&nbsp;**Use the same phrasing and structure across checklists, so staff aren’t re-learning how to interpret the list every time.

 For example:

 - Always use “Check fridge temperature is below 5°C”
- Don’t switch between “Check fridges” / “Monitor cold storage” / “Record fridge temp”

 ## Step 5: Make your checklists part of the daily routine

 The goal is it build checklists into your team’s workflow so they’re completed consistently, accurately, and without delay - even during busy or understaffed shifts.

 The best-written checklist won’t protect your kitchen if it’s ignored, rushed, or filled in after the fact. To have real impact, your opening and closing checks must be embedded into how the team operates. They should feel like a normal, non-negotiable part of the shift - not a box-ticking exercise bolted on at the end.

 Here’s how to make that happen in practice.

 **Assign clear responsibility and record specifics**

 Every item on your checklist should be completed by a named person or role - not “the team.” In Pilla,&nbsp; full data-trail is recorded for every Check included who has carried out the Check and when.&nbsp;

 **Set a realistic completion time**

 Your checklist should match the time available. If your opening list takes 30 minutes and staff are only given 10, it will be rushed or skipped.

 - Observe how long it takes to complete each section thoroughly.
- Build that time into the rota — opening and closing are part of the shift, not unpaid extras.
- Avoid piling all tasks onto one person — spread the work logically.

 Every work activity inside Pilla is given a start time and a target finish time, make sure that these times are realistic and achievable.

 **Integrate checks into shift handover**

 Make opening and closing checklists part of your handover process. The next team should know exactly what’s been done and what hasn’t.

 - For opening: the shift lead confirms all checks are completed before prep begins.
- For closing: manager or supervisor reviews the list and signs off once each task is done to standard.

 **Train every team member on how to complete each check**

 Don’t assume new team members know how to “check the fridges” or “clean the prep area” to your standard.

 - During onboarding, walk each new starter through the checklist step by step.
- Show them what “done properly” looks like in your kitchen (use examples or photos).
- Explain why each check matters — tie it back to food safety, customer experience, and legal compliance.

 **Follow up and act when checks aren’t completed properly**

 Review completed checklists regularly. Look for patterns:

 - Are certain tasks always skipped or rushed?
- Are the same issues being picked up by the next shift?
- Are any checks being completed without the corresponding actions happening?

 Staff can [mark Checks as issues](https://yourpilla.com/blog/issues-corrections) inside Pilla and they can notify managers, this is an ideal issue escalation process and will help you track commonly found issues and maybe a need to update your checklists.

 **Keep it visible and easy to access**

 Whether your checklist is digital or paper-based, it should always be within reach:

 - Use tablets or phones if using a digital system like Pilla
- Mount printed checklists on clipboards or inside cupboard doors
- Never hide them in folders, drawers, or emails — the harder it is to access, the less likely it is to be used

 ## Step 6: Review and improve your checklists regularly

 Keep your checklists up to date with how your kitchen actually runs — so they remain useful, relevant, and accurate as things change.

 Kitchens evolve, menus change, equipment breaks, staff come and go. What worked six months ago might not be working now. That’s why it’s important to treat your opening and closing checklists as living documents - not one-off jobs that get laminated and forgotten.

 **A checklist that isn’t reviewed regularly becomes one of two things:**

 1. $1
2. $1

 Here’s how to prevent that from happening.

 **Review checklists monthly (or after any big change)**

 Don’t wait for a problem to happen. Schedule a regular review.

 Trigger points for review might include:

 - A new piece of equipment has been installed
- The menu has changed and introduced new prep routines
- A food safety inspection or audit identified an issue
- Staff feedback indicates something isn’t working
- A near-miss or incident occurred (e.g. fridge left open, allergen error)

 Ask yourself:

 - Are all listed tasks still necessary and in the right order?
- Are there missing checks that could’ve prevented recent issues?
- Are roles and responsibilities still assigned to the right people?

 **Gather team feedback - especially from those who use the checklist daily**

 Your team will often spot things management misses. They’re the ones doing the checks and seeing where real-world work doesn’t quite match what’s on paper.

 Ask questions like:

 - “Is there anything on the checklist that feels unnecessary now?”
- “Is there anything you do every day that’s not on the list but should be?”
- “Do any tasks need more clarity or explanation?”

 **Update wording to match training language and SOPs**

 When you update your SOPs (standard operating procedures), update your checklists to match — and vice versa.

 Consistency helps staff learn faster.
If the training manual says “Leave sanitiser for 60 seconds contact time,” but the checklist just says “Clean surfaces,” it causes confusion or shortcuts. Use the same wording throughout your systems — and link the checklist directly to training guides or laminated visuals where needed.
