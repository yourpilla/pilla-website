  - Manual handling risk assessments are crucial and legally required to prevent injuries.&nbsp;
- You&nbsp;should carry out several manual handling risk assessments by grouping activities together. For example, all lower risk activities such as moving empty trays and cutlery can be grouped together because they are similar in size and risk. But, you should carry out a new risk assessment for higher risk activities such as handling heavy deliveries or moving items stored high in a warehouse.
- PiIla&nbsp;has a pre-built manual handling risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. List the Manual Handling Tasks Being Assessed

 Start by identifying the specific manual handling tasks that need to be assessed. These might involve lifting, carrying, pushing, or pulling heavy or awkward loads. Concentrate on tasks that pose a higher risk of injury.

 Why it matters:

 Listing the tasks creates the foundation for your risk assessment. It helps ensure that you are focusing on significant tasks that could cause harm if mismanaged. It also narrows the scope, allowing you to assess risks comprehensively within those confined parameters.

 What good answers look like:

 Provide a clear list of tasks, such as:

 - Changing beer barrels in the cellar
- Unloading stock from delivery vehicles
- Moving waste bins to external storage areas

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Walk through your business and identify where manual handling tasks occur:

 - Observe which tasks involve moving heavy or unwieldy items.
- Note tasks that require repetitive movements or awkward postures.
- Consider input from staff on which tasks they find most challenging.

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - “We do manual handling all the time; everything could be assessed!” Too broad. Focus on significant tasks or those with higher risks.
- Ignoring seasonal tasks, such as moving outdoor furniture at the start and end of summer.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Review job descriptions to ensure all relevant tasks are captured.
- Use staff feedback to identify tasks that may not be immediately obvious.
- Update this list if tasks change or new tasks are introduced.

 ## 2. Equipment to Minimise Manual Handling

 This section focuses on what kind of equipment your business has in place to reduce manual handling and associated risks. Equipment could include trolleys, pallet trucks, or mechanical aids.

 Why it matters:

 The best way to protect staff from injury is by mechanising or aiding physical tasks, minimising the need for manual handling whenever possible. Proper equipment reduces the need to lift or carry heavy loads, preventing strain injuries.

 What good answers look like:

 Include information such as:

 - The type of equipment provided (e.g., sack barrows, lifting aids).
- How the equipment is intended to be used (e.g., transport barrels, move crates, etc.).
- If applicable, note areas without appropriate equipment available and how you plan to address it.

 Example of a strong answer:

 - Flatbed trolleys are provided to move deliveries from the door to storage.
- Staff have access to a barrel trolley specifically designed for changing heavy kegs.
- Where the path is uneven, carts are used for safer handling of heavy crates.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask yourself:

 - What equipment is available for manual handling tasks?
- Is it located close to where the tasks are performed?
- Is the equipment in good condition and regularly maintained?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - “The team just carries things.” Risky if equipment to facilitate manual handling exists but is not utilised due to inconvenience or inadequate training.
- “We share one trolley between multiple areas.” Inadequate; separate tasks may need individual equipment to ensure availability when needed.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Ensure all staff are trained to use the equipment safely and effectively.
- Keep equipment well maintained and easily accessible.
- Review operations regularly to identify where additional equipment could reduce manual handling further.

 ## 3. Avoid Lifting Large Loads

 Describe the strategies or practices in place to eliminate or significantly reduce the lifting of large or heavy loads. This might include task redesign, splitting loads, or strategic sourcing to avoid excessive weight handling.

 Why it matters:

 Large and awkward loads impose strain on the body, increasing the risk of injury. Where possible, you should aim to eliminate or reduce the need for handling such loads through smart planning and task management.

 What good answers look like:

 Example strategies could include:

 - Encouraging suppliers to deliver stock in smaller, manageable loads.
- Splitting deliveries into smaller parcels where feasible before moving them.
- Using collaborative lifting techniques for unavoidable large items.

 Example of a thorough answer:

 - Ask suppliers to deliver items in smaller boxes when possible to reduce load size.
- Use team lifts for larger items such as commercial kitchen appliances.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - What large loads are handled regularly? Can they be broken down or eliminated?
- Are suppliers willing to assist with better packaging or delivery options?
- Do tasks inevitably involve large loads? Can you implement techniques like team lifts?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - “We lift large loads because it's quicker.” Speed over safety is short-sighted. Injury risks incur bigger costs and downtime.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Communicate with suppliers to adjust delivery methods if large, cumbersome loads are an issue.
- Implement procedures for handling large loads that prioritise safety (e.g. team lifts, equipment use).

 ## 4. Reduce Stooping and Twisting

 This section focuses on how you will reduce the common risks associated with stooping and twisting when handling equipment or loads. These movements can cause significant back strain and injuries.

 Why it matters:

 Injuries to the spine and back muscles from stooping and twisting motions are among the most common manual handling injuries. These injuries are preventable through improved task design, workspace ergonomics, and proper training.

 What good answers look like:

 Example strategies could include:

 - Storing frequently used items at waist height to minimize bending.
- Reorganising shelving to ensure heavy or commonly accessed items are no lower than knee level.
- Training staff to pivot their feet rather than twist at the waist when moving loads.

 Example of a thorough answer:

 - Items needed frequently are stored at chest to waist height. Staff are instructed to pivot their body and feet towards the direction of the load.
- Advice provided during training, with visual aids by storage areas.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - Are staff consistently bending or twisting to access frequently used items?
- Can storage be rearranged to make it easier to reach items without stooping?
- Do staff know proper techniques for turning and moving items safely?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - Failing to use reorganised storage just out of habit — retrain and reinforce changes.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Rearrange storage to reduce the need to reach above the shoulders or below the knees.
- Regularly review and revise storage layout based on feedback and observed practices.
- Incorporate ergonomic training into staff inductions and refreshers.

 ## 5. Reduce Over-Reaching and Upward Reaching

 Explain how you will reduce the necessity for staff to over-reach or reach upwards, which can cause strains to arms, shoulders, and back.

 Why it matters:

 Reaching above shoulder height increases the risk of dropping loads and can stress arm and shoulder muscles, particularly when done frequently or involving heavy items.

 What good answers look like:

 Solution ideas might include:

 - Repositioning shelves so heavier items are stored at waist level.
- Installing step ladders for safe access to high shelves.
- Segregating storage based on frequency and ease of access.

 Example of a thorough answer:

 - A step ladder is provided for accessing items stored above shoulder height.
- Heavy items always placed at or below waist height on storage racks.
- Regular checks ensure that nothing heavy is placed at high levels.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - Are tasks or tools consistently located above shoulder height?
- Are staff using appropriate aides like step ladders to access high items?
- Are heavy loads being stored high due to space issues?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - Not providing or failing to replace step aids or ladders when they are worn.
- Ignoring the need for reaching tools even when staff mention difficulties.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Put procedures in place to ensure lightweight items are stored higher, while heavier items are stored lower.
- Provide suitable equipment like step ladders for accessing high shelves safely.
- Monitor and adjust storage habits and equipment inventory based on feedback and observation.

 ## 6. Reduce Travel Distances During Manual Handling

 Describe strategies for reducing the distances staff must cover when manually handling goods, as excessive carrying can increase the risk of fatigue and injury.

 Why it matters:

 Long carry distances increase the likelihood of slips, trips, drops, or strain injuries. By reducing the distance that heavy loads are manually carried, you can help prevent accidents and preserve energy.

 What good answers look like:

 Potential strategies include:

 - Using carts or trolleys with multiple drop-off points to limit carry distance.
- Reorganizing storage areas for ease of access.
- Strategically planning deliveries and collection points to minimise carrying distances.

 Example of a thorough answer:

 - Trolleys are in use for all stock movements to reduce carry distances.
- Staff encouraged to move stock in stages using designated drop-points.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - Are there areas where staff commonly carry heavy loads over long distances?
- Could storage solutions be repositioned to reduce the distance from collection and return points?
- Are there drop off/pickup points that can serve as staging areas?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - Creating new drop-off points that clutter workspaces instead of helping to organise them.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Introduce intermediate storage areas to serve as catchment points.
- Use push carts or trolleys instead of carrying whenever possible.

 ## 7. Ensure Loads Are Balanced and Stable

 This section explains the procedures or training in place to ensure that loads are balanced and stable enough to be handled safely. A focus on load stability can prevent accidents and injuries from slips or drops.

 Why it matters:

 Unbalanced loads can easily tip, fall, or require awkward adjustments during carrying, increasing the likelihood of injuries to employees and other hazards like spills or equipment damage.

 What good answers look like:

 Answer strategies can include:

 - Training staff how to properly arrange loads to optimise balance and stability.
- Providing information on packaging best practices, like shrink wrap and strapping.
- Implementing quality checks to ensure loads are uniformly packed and well-contained.

 Example of a strong answer:

 - Staff training includes best practices for balancing loads on carts and trolleys.
- Boxes are checked to ensure they are secure and stacked safely.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - Are loads visibly wobbly or unstable when being transported?
- Can staff consistently spot when loads are improperly balanced?
- Is there a risk of disruptions (e.g., tip overs) during transportation of loads?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - Failing to correct staff who rush setup of loads without attention to balance.
- Overloading trolleys or carts past safe capacity.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Educate staff on how to properly balance and secure loads before movement.
- Provide handouts or demonstrations on effective load arrangement techniques.

 ## 8. Identify Additional Controls

 Now that you’ve covered the core areas of manual handling risk, consider what other controls are necessary or would additionally benefit safety, comfort, or efficiency.

 Why it matters:

 Frequently, risk assessments uncover gaps or opportunities for improvement that might not fit neatly into prior sections. This step is your opportunity to address those insights and build a more comprehensive approach.

 What good answers look like:

 Example additions might include:

 - Implementing new training modules on manual handling.
- Procuring new lifting aids as needs change.
- Addressing noise or distraction factors around manual handling areas.

 Example of a strong answer:

 - Retraining sessions scheduled quarterly to reinforce manual handling best practice.
- Exploring potential procurement of new electric pallet movers in high-traffic areas.
- Noise and light levels in storage regions examined for adjustments to reduce fatigue.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - Have risks or issues emerged that weren't directly tackled in the above sections?
- Are there conditions or safety aspects staff have highlighted as troublesome?
- What proactive steps might further reduce injury risk or enhance operational flow?

 Best practices to follow:

 - Regularly assess and adapt your procedures or equipment based on direct feedback.
- Communicate plans or potential changes to staff for insight and cooperation.

 ## 9. Monitor and Review Your Controls

 Detail how you will ensure that the controls you've implemented remain effective over time. Monitoring strategies should focus on sustainability and continuous improvement.

 Why it matters:

 Monitoring helps determine whether your current measures are working effectively. It is also crucial to verify compliance, adjust when necessary, and ultimately validate the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of your solutions.

 What good answers look like:

 Describe:

 - Which methods will be used to measure success (e.g. tracking injuries, feedback loops, observation).
- How often you’ll review and refine controls.
- What process is in place for logging issues or suggestions for improvement.

 Example of a strong answer:

 - Injury incidences and near-miss reports reviewed monthly during health &amp; safety meetings.
- Spot checks and observations conducted quarterly by health &amp; safety officers.
- Feedback on manual handling practices actively encouraged and reviewed via anonymous staff surveys semi-annually.

 How to answer this for yourself:

 Ask:

 - What tools are in place to capture feedback on manual handling activities?
- How will changes in regulation, staffing, or equipment be addressed in future reviews?
- How frequently should practices be reassessed to stay current and effective?

 Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):

 - Leaving controls static without frequent evaluation.
- Assuming existing measures will always be adequate as conditions evolve.

 Best practices to follow:

 - Establish a culture of iterative improvement with regular assessments and evaluations.
- Collect and analyse data to inform future improvements and maintain compliance.
- Engage staff to share feedback, and integrate findings into policy updates and training development.
