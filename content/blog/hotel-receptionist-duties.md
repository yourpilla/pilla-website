 ## Step 1: Describe Your Hotel and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 When crafting a job description for a new hire or revising it for current employees, including a section at the top to describe your hotel is crucial. Candidates need to understand why they would want to work with you. If writing for existing employees, this section reminds them of your values and what makes your hotel unique.

 **Your goal is to convey to the candidate:**

 - The type of hotel you are
- The style of service you deliver
- What working in your environment feels like

 Use this simple 3-part structure to begin:

 **1. What type of hotel are you?**

 Start with a defining statement: “We’re a boutique hotel / a large chain hotel / a family-run inn / a luxury resort…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Describe the service experience and pace. Examples include:

 - “We cater to discerning guests seeking a personalised experience.”
- “We handle high guest volumes, offering quick check-ins and essential service.”
- “We focus on attention to detail and creating memorable stays.”

 **3. What distinguishes your hotel as an attractive workplace?**

 Mention aspects like team dynamics, values, or unique features:

 - “Our team fosters a supportive and collaborative work environment.”
- “We offer ongoing training and development for our staff.”
- “Our commitment to sustainable hospitality sets us apart.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you find it challenging to articulate these points, consider these questions:

 - How does a regular day look like for your reception team?
- What is the guest experience you strive to create?
- How does your team engage with guests? Warm and welcoming or professional and efficient?
- Do you use specific systems or technologies at the front desk?
- What makes your staff stay and enjoy working at your hotel?

 **Example 1: Boutique Hotel**

 We’re a luxurious boutique hotel in the heart of the countryside, priding ourselves on delivering personalized service to our guests. Our team is dedicated to creating memorable experiences, ensuring our guests feel welcomed and valued from the moment they step through the door.

 **Example 2: Large Chain Hotel**

 We’re a bustling city centre hotel, part of a renowned global chain, providing efficient and friendly service to business and leisure travellers. Our reception team thrives on delivering speedy check-ins, local area knowledge, and excellent customer service to a diverse array of guests.

 ## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Hotel Receptionist

 Many job descriptions fall short due to vague responsibilities like “assist guests” or by borrowing descriptions that don’t match their actual operations. Your aim should be to clearly define responsibilities relevant to your hotel’s operations.

 **Your goal is to list tasks specific to your hotel’s daily operations.**

 Include 6–10 bullet points detailing the receptionist’s duties, ensuring they reflect daily realities.

 Organise responsibilities into three chronological categories:

 **1. Pre-Arrival and Check-In Responsibilities**

 Tasks at the start of a guest’s stay. Consider:

 - Who sets up the front desk before shifts?
- What preparations are necessary for seamless check-ins?

 Common examples:

 - Prepare and organise check-in documents
- Welcome guests warmly and efficiently handle check-ins
- Coordinate with housekeeping to ensure room readiness

 **2. In-Stay Guest Services Responsibilities**

 Maintaining service throughout a guest's stay. Consider:

 - How often do receptionists interact with guests during their visit?
- Are tasks strictly desk-based, or involve wider guest support?

 Common examples:

 - Assist guests with queries, providing local area information
- Coordinate bookings for amenities or external services
- Manage and maintain the lobby’s presentation and cleanliness

 **3. Departure and Closing Responsibilities**

 Tasks to wrap up a guest’s stay or a shift. Consider:

 - What needs to occur at check-out?
- How are you closing the day or shift?

 Common examples:

 - Ensure smooth check-out and handle billing activities
- Gather guest feedback and address any unresolved issues
- Update guest records and prepare for shift handovers

 **Methods to gather current process insights:**

 - Observe Receptionists: Monitor their interactions with guests and coordination tasks.
- Gather Input: Ask them to summarize their main duties and peak responsibilities.
- Consult Supervisors: Gain insights on expectations and critical tasks from management.

 Questions to consider:

 - What is a typical shift like?
- How do they manage guest interactions and multitasking?
- What are the equipment and system maintenance protocols they follow?
- How do they align with the housekeeping and concierge teams?
- What training or onboarding do new receptionists receive?

 **Example for a small, upscale hotel**

 Responsibilities as a hotel receptionist include:

 - Efficiently organising and conducting guest check-ins and check-outs
- Providing guests with a warm or courteous welcome and helpful area tips
- Liaising with housekeeping to ensure room readiness
- Handling guest requests promptly, addressing concerns efficiently
- Updating guest records and preparation for future shifts

 **Example for a high-volume city hotel**

 Responsibilities as a hotel receptionist include:

 - Managing a fast-paced front desk while ensuring welcoming guest interactions
- Overseeing guest check-in and checkout processes efficiently
- Providing accurate local recommendations and directions
- Maintaining a polished lobby appearance
- Assisting guests with transportation bookings or dinner reservations

 ## Step 3: Define the Desired Skills of the Hotel Receptionist

 With responsibilities clarified, spell out the skill set needed for success. This helps applicants self-filter and streamlines the application process. Tailor the skills list to your hotel’s specific requirements rather than adopting broad criteria from elsewhere.

 **Your goal is to create tailored skill lists: essential and preferred skills based on your operations, not aspirational ideals.**

 **1. Reflect on the responsibilities**

 Ask for each task: “What skill enables someone to perform this proficiently?”

 Example:

 - Handling multi-line phone systems requires multitasking skills
- Offering travel advice or local insights calls for strong communication skills
- Processing guest payments requires proficiency in using hotel software

 **2. Divide skills into categories**

 - Must-have skills: Essential competencies expected on day one.
- Nice-to-have skills: Additional skills that would be beneficial but are not required.

 **Common Ideal Skill Areas**

 - Proficiency with hotel booking and reservation systems
- Exceptional verbal and written communication
- Strong organisational and multitasking abilities
- High-level customer service and interpersonal skills
- Problem-solving skills for guest requests and issues
- Cash handling and billing accuracy
- Familiarity with industry-specific software and applications

 **Example for a personalised service-oriented hotel**

 Must-Have Skills

 - Excellent customer service orientation and ability to personalise guest interactions
- Proficiency in hotel management software like Opera or Fidelio
- Strong written and oral communication skills
- Attention to detail for managing reservations and guest billing

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

 - Knowledge of additional languages for international guests
- Experience with event planning or concierge services
- A keen interest in local culture and destinations

 **Example for a fast-paced urban hotel**

 Must-Have Skills

 - Comfortable managing high guest volumes and multitasking
- Knowledgeable in using hotel POS systems and multi-line phone systems
- Quick problem-solving skills to address guest concerns
- Excellent English proficiency and clear communication

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

 - Previous experience in high-traffic hotel reception settings
- Capable of offering dining or local experience recommendations
- Understanding of additional business systems or software packages

 ## Step 4: Determine Required Experience

 After mapping the skill set, defining the necessary experience is crucial. This avoids misalignment in expectations and aids potential candidates in gauging fit quickly.

 Beware of overstating experience needs; it might deter capable candidates, especially if you provide training. Align advertised experience levels with role expectations realistically.

 **Your goal is to be clear about the experience the role demands — in terms of type, rather than just duration.**

 **1. Identify the experience level: Entry-level, Experienced, or Advanced**

 - Entry-level: Open to individuals without prior experience, willing to train.
- Mid-level: Requires candidates with hands-on experience in a similar hotel environment.
- Advanced: Needs individuals ready to lead, mentor, or independently manage critical reception functions.

 Choose commitment according to need; avoid inflated seniority labels which might lead to underpayment and overworking.

 **2. Specify the nature of required experience**

 Instead of only using “2 years’ experience,” explain the type of environment.

 - Do they need experience in a large-scale commercial hotel setting?
- Do they need to have used specific management software or systems previously?
- Is familiarity with high guest interaction frequency necessary?

 Clarify criteria — be conscious of differing background suitability.

 **3. Clarify training opportunities or expectations**

 If willing to train, let candidates know. If instant proficiency is required, indicate that too.

 **Example for an Intermediate Receptionist**

 "We’re seeking candidates with a minimum of 6 months of hands-on receptionist experience, familiar with hotel property management systems. You should be adept in maintaining professionalism while multitasking. Training on specific processes and systems will be provided, but a quick adaptation is anticipated."

 **Example for a Trainee-Friendly Role**

 "Previous experience isn’t required, but genuine enthusiasm for the hospitality industry is necessary. We offer comprehensive training on our systems, guest service standards, and communication styles."

 **Example for a Senior Reception Role**

 "A minimum of 1 year’s experience at a mid-to-large hotel, with readiness to take charge of reception shifts confidently. Proficiency in property management systems and overseeing junior team members is essential."

 ## Step 5: Describe Essential Personality Traits and Cultural Fit

 While skills matter, personality plays a critical role in determining long-term suitability and integration within your team. Articulating traits that thrive in your hotel’s environment can support achieving this.

 Avoid generic descriptions such as “hard-working team player” — instead, describe the characteristics that lead to a successful fit at your hotel.

 **Your goal is to detail required attitudes, energy, and behaviours in line with your hotel’s values and operations.**

 **1. Reflect on your current team strengths**

 Consider:

 - What commonalities do your top-performing team members share?
- Which traits have led to underperformance previously?
- Is your team dynamic more energetic and fast-paced, or calm and attentive?
- How are guest interactions managed — warm and friendly or serene and professional?

 Identify key terms that reflect the desired attitude behind your reception desk.

 **2. Articulate clearly, avoid vagueness**

 Instead of a generic “team player” label, detail behaviours:

 - “Offers immediate assistance when colleagues are busy”
- “Effectively communicates during tight scheduling or calm periods”
- “Recognises frequent guests by name and preferences”

 **3. Match the role to pressure levels**

 - For high-pressure hotels: someone calm, focused, and organised.
- For personal service-oriented venues: a warm, engaging, observational candidate.

 **Example for a Fast-paced Environment**

 "You will excel in our dynamic hotel if you maintain composure under busy conditions, exhibit reliable multitasking, and possess a teamwork-centric attitude. Being proactive, supportive, and detail-oriented aligns well with our team-driven mentality during peak operational hours."

 **Example for a Personalised Service Hotel**

 "This role best suits someone warm, engaging, and dedicated to delivering personalised guest experiences. You should be capable of managing expectations effectively, bringing positivity into each shift, and standing for dedication towards hospitality excellence."

 **Tips if you’re unsure**

 - Survey your team: “What personality types do you prefer working with?”
- Reflect on unsuccessful hires — what was lacking?
- Be realistic. If your hotel is hectic, suggest needing practicality and focus over creativity and flexibility.

 ## Step 6: Include Compensation and Benefits Details

 Transparency in this step is crucial. Eventual candidates expect clarity regarding pay and benefits. Honesty here builds trust and prevents wasting anyone’s time due to misled expectations.

 Being clear establishes your professionalism and marks your hotel as a trustworthy employer.

 **Include details on:**

 - Salary range or pay rate
- Perks and benefits
- What sets work-life in your hotel apart

 **1. Clearly specify pay — whether hourly or salary**

 State exact figures or ranges. Consider exploring competing venues or matching positions for market standard understanding. Base expectations on roles’ demand level when uncertain.

 - Example: £10.50–£12.00 per hour DOE
- £11 per hour + incentives, reviewed bi-annually

 **2. Enumerate staff perks and benefits**

 Highlight the little things that could make your hotel job appealing beyond salary:

 - Free or discounted meals and stays
- Paid training or professional development courses
- Split shift breaks or early-finish schedules
- Contribution-based bonuses and incentives
- Health and well-being support schemes
- Clear progression paths within reception or hotel roles

 Examples:

 - Complimentary staff meals during shifts
- Staff incentives like bonuses based on guest feedback
- Discounted stays for friends and family
- Professional development courses and fully paid seminars
- Annual team getaways after successful seasons

 **3. Detail opportunities for growth and engagement**

 If genuine career advancement or support features are available, ensure this is known.

 - Example: Opportunities for growth within management development programs.
- Recognition schemes designed for positive reinforcement of achievements.

 **Example section for Salary &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £10.50–£12.00 per hour based on experience

 Incentives: Year-end bonuses for high guest satisfaction ratings

 Perks:

 - Free meals and reduced rates for on-site accommodations
- Comprehensive well-being and mental health resources
- Paid training programs and ongoing industry certification opportunities
- Shifts crafted around work-life balance preferences

 **Helpful suggestions if you find this challenging:**

 - Ask yourself what would make the role attractive for longer tenure?
- Be candid — overstatement could backfire; honesty is key.
- If compensation isn’t exceptional, focus on fostering other attractive elements (professional growth, team spirit, hospitality culture).
