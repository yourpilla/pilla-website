  - Quick: Essential questions plus brief trial for volume hiring
  - Standard: Behavioural interview plus practical assessment to test service capability
  - Extended: Include team interaction for senior assistant roles

  Step 3: Develop Scenario-Based Questions
  Ask for specific examples: handling busy events, working in teams, adapting to changes. Focus on service attitude, problem-solving, and reliability over advanced skills.

  Step 4: Plan Practical Trial Activities
  Test station setup, guest service simulation, and teamwork support. 30-45 minutes reveals work patterns, organisation, and customer service instincts. Watch for initiative and adaptability.

  Step 5: Use Consistent Scoring Methods
  Weight teamwork and communication (40%), practical efficiency (30%), and initiative (30%). Focus on service attitude and reliability rather than perfect technical execution.

## Step 1. Define Who You're Looking For

Catering assistant roles vary dramatically between venues, requiring different combinations of service skills, adaptability, and operational support capability. Understanding your specific demands ensures you hire assistants who'll thrive in your environment.

**Your goal is to identify candidates with strong service instincts, excellent teamwork skills, and genuine enthusiasm for supporting exceptional guest experiences.**

Use this comprehensive approach to clarify your catering assistant requirements:

**1. Assess Your Operation's Service Style and Demands**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We run high-volume corporate events requiring assistants who set up quickly, coordinate with multiple teams, and maintain professional presentation throughout long events / operate intimate fine dining functions where assistants interact directly with guests and must demonstrate refined service awareness / manage diverse catering operations from casual buffets to formal plated service requiring versatile assistants who adapt to different service styles..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What types of events do you cater and how do service styles vary?
- Do assistants work independently or as part of coordinated teams?
- Are you serving corporate clients, social events, or mixed clientele?
- What's the typical event size and complexity of setup requirements?
- Do assistants need to interact directly with guests or work behind the scenes?

**2. Define Your Service Philosophy and Quality Standards**

Your assistant requirements change based on service approach and guest expectations:

- "Our catering emphasises flawless execution and elegant presentation, requiring assistants who take pride in details, anticipate needs, and maintain professional composure throughout challenging events."

- "We operate efficient, high-volume service where assistants must work quickly under pressure whilst maintaining quality standards and supporting team coordination during complex events."

- "Our boutique catering focuses on personalised service, needing assistants who communicate well with guests, adapt to special requests, and contribute to creating memorable experiences."

- "We specialise in corporate functions requiring assistants who understand business environments, maintain discretion, and deliver consistent professional service across varied venues."

**3. Establish Service Level Requirements for Your Operation**

Different catering environments require different capability balances:
