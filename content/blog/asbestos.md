 Asbestos is a serious health risk that businesses in the UK need to manage carefully. The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 sets out what employers must do to protect people from asbestos in the workplace. If your building was built before 2000, there's a good chance it has asbestos. So, it's crucial to find out if asbestos is present and make a plan to manage the risks.

 Exposure to asbestos fibres can cause lung cancer and other diseases, which may not appear for years. That's why you need to prevent these fibres from getting into the air in the first place. The regulations say you must find out if asbestos is present, keep an up-to-date record of its location and condition, assess the risks, and take steps to manage them. This might include regular checks, labelling, staff training, and hiring specialists for repairs or removal.

 In the U.S., OSHA has specific standards (29 CFR 1910.1001) for managing asbestos exposure at work. Just like in the UK, the goal is to protect workers from breathing in asbestos fibres. Employers need to find out if asbestos is present, monitor exposure levels, provide proper protective equipment and training, and keep records. They may also need to put up warning signs and use special work practices to limit fibre release during maintenance or removal.

 Including asbestos in your health and safety management system is a must. It helps you stay on top of legal duties, control serious risks, and keep people safe. Having a clear plan and procedures in place is the best way to manage this hidden hazard.

 ## Asbestos arrangements

 Asbestos can be found in any industrial, commercial, or residential building built or refurbished before the year 2000. If your venue falls into this bracket, your company has a duty to ensure that people working for you are not exposed to asbestos-containing materials in the course of their work and that you do not expose other people to the risk of exposure to asbestos as a result of your work activity.

 Your company should control this potential hazard by following these safety arrangements:

 - For buildings built prior to 2000 which are owned by your company:Responsible Persons should arrange an asbestos survey which records all asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) located on site. Your company is responsible for addressing the recommendations documented, whether that involves removal, labeling, or just managing the locations recorded. The Responsible Persons will address the action plan in line with the recommended timescales.
