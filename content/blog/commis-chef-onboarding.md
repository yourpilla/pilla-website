## Commis Chef Training Plan: Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves

**Must-Have Elements:**

- **Safety and Hygiene Training**: Food safety, kitchen safety, and proper hygiene protocols are non-negotiable foundations.
- **Knife Skills Development**: Basic cutting techniques must be mastered before advancing to more complex tasks.
- **Mise en Place Discipline**: Organisational skills and preparation systems are essential for success.
- **Recipe Following Ability**: The capacity to accurately follow and execute recipes is fundamental.
- **Station Awareness**: Understanding how different stations function and interact is critical.
- **Communication Skills**: Clear, concise kitchen communication during service is essential.
- **Quality Awareness**: The ability to recognise and maintain quality standards is required.
- **Feedback Receptiveness**: Willingness to receive and implement corrections is necessary for growth.

**Nice-to-Have Elements:**

- **Leadership Skills**: Supervising others is not an immediate requirement for a commis chef.
- **Specialised Dietary Knowledge**: Advanced understanding of allergies and special diets can be developed progressively.

## Adapting the Commis Chef Training Plan

Every kitchen has unique needs, and your training plan should reflect your specific operation. Consider these adaptation points:

**Menu Complexity Considerations**:
- For complex menus, extend recipe training time and reduce initial service expectations
- For simpler menus, accelerate to more advanced techniques and station rotation

**Kitchen Size Adjustments**:
- In smaller kitchens, focus on versatility across fewer stations
- In larger brigades, extend station rotation to ensure comprehensive exposure

**Service Style Modifications**:
- Fine dining operations should emphasise precision and presentation detail
- High-volume operations should prioritise speed and consistency techniques

**Team Integration Factors**:
- Consider existing team strengths and weaknesses when assigning mentors
- Adjust communication training based on established kitchen culture

Remember that this five-day plan provides a foundation, but true proficiency develops over weeks and months of practical application. Regular check-ins, continuing education, and progressive responsibility increases should follow this initial onboarding period.
