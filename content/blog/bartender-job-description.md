## Step 1: Start with the Venue’s Atmosphere and Introduce Your Business

 A brief opening statement about your bar helps prospective bartenders understand the environment in which they’ll be working. Even when drafting a job description for current staff, a reminder of your venue's atmosphere can reinforce expectations.

 **Provide information to help candidates quickly understand:**

- The type of bar you operate

- Your style of service and customer interaction

- The vibe and values unique to your establishment

 Use this straightforward 3-part structure:

 **1. What type of venue are you?**

 Begin with a concise descriptor: “We’re a cosy neighbourhood pub / a bustling cocktail bar / a high-end hotel lounge / a live music venue serving craft beers…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Clarify the pace and nature of customer service. For example:

- “We offer fast, friendly service catering mainly to sports fans and locals.”

- “Our focus is on creating a sophisticated, leisurely experience with hand-crafted cocktails.”

- “We thrive on a high-energy atmosphere with live music and late-night hours.”

 **3. What makes your place different or appealing to work at?**

 This could include team culture, events, or standout offerings. For instance:

- “We host weekly themed cocktail nights and tastings for staff.”

- “Our bar is known for its extensive whisky selection and knowledgeable staff.”

- “We pride ourselves on sustainable practices, sourcing ingredients locally.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you’re struggling with what to include, consider these questions:

- What’s a typical shift like at your bar?

- What volume of customers do you serve during peak times?

- Is your service bar-based or mixed with table service?

- What’s the team dynamic — lively and fast-paced or more relaxed?

- Do you host events or theme nights regularly?

- What compliments do staff most frequently receive from customers?

 **Example 1: High-energy sports bar**

 We’re a lively sports bar located downtown, popular among locals and tourists alike. Our team manages high volumes with quick service, maintaining a welcoming and energetic environment. We offer a range of craft beers and classic bar bites, with big screens for all major games.

 **Example 2: Upscale cocktail lounge**

 Our venue is an elegant cocktail lounge known for its premium spirits and sophisticated ambience. The pace is relaxed, with an emphasis on customer experience and crafting exquisite cocktails. We offer regular training sessions on mixology and spirits knowledge to our team.

## Step 2: Describe Key Responsibilities for the Bartender

 A common pitfall in job descriptions is being overly broad or copying generic duties that don’t accurately reflect your bar's operations.

 **Your goal is to tailor your list so it mirrors the duties specific to your venue.**

 Create a list with about 6–10 bullet points illustrating the bartender’s responsibilities in your establishment — focus on what they will actually be doing day-to-day.

 Divide the role into three operational phases to aid clarity:

 **1. Preparation and setup duties**

 These tasks happen prior to customer service hours or at the beginning of a shift.

 Consider:

- Who is responsible for setting up the bar?

- What preparations are required before opening?

 Typical tasks might include:

- Restock and organise bar with glassware, garnishes, and liquor

- Check taps and prepare kegs for service

- Mix simple syrups or pre-prepare mixes for cocktails

- Ensure cleanliness and order of bar area pre-service

 **2. Service duties**

 These are essential tasks occurring during trading hours.

 Reflect on:

- How do bartenders interact with patrons?

- Do they need to manage both drink preparations and orders?

- Are they involved in serving food as well?

 Common tasks might be:

- Create cocktails and serve drinks according to customer specifications

- Engage with customers to provide recommendations and answer inquiries

- Operate cash register or POS systems efficiently

- Maintain speed and accuracy during peak hours

- Coordinate with floor staff to manage orders and table service (if applicable)

 **3. Cleaning and closing duties**

 These are tasks associated with the end of a shift or day.

 Think about:

- Who is tasked with closing procedures?

- What cleaning tasks are necessary?

 Common tasks include:

- Clean down bar surfaces, sinks, and equipment

- Properly store remaining stock and prepare for the next service shift

- Complete closing checklists and waste management tasks

- Secure all monetary takings and till operations

 **If you already have Bartenders but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe Them on Shift: Watch the way they manage the bar, interact with customers, and handle rush periods

- Ask for Their Feedback: Encourage staff to list their critical tasks for completeness

- Consult Managers or Shift Supervisors: Obtain further details or any overlooked responsibilities

 Useful questions to discuss with your Bartenders:

- What activities frame the start and end of your shifts?

- How do you ensure the quality and consistency of our drinks?

- What are the key steps in preparing for a busy night?

- How do you work with the kitchen and serving team during service?

- What training methods have you adapted to newcomers this season?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask an existing staff member to walk through a typical shift with you

- Review your opening and closing checklists for guidance

- Identify issues that occur when service is subpar and ensure these are addressed in your responsibilities list

 **Example for an upscale cocktail bar**

 In this role, your responsibilities will include:

- Preparing the bar area with fresh ingredients and glassware before opening

- Crafting classic and contemporary cocktails to the highest standard

- Engaging customers with product knowledge and drink recommendations

- Maintaining a clean workspace and following hygiene protocols

- Completing nightly cash-up and stock take routines after service

 **Example for a high-volume sports bar**

 In this position, you will be responsible for:

- Setting up the bar with kegs, bottles, and essential supplies for the day

- Mixing drinks and pulling pints swiftly without compromising quality

- Serving patrons efficiently, managing large crowds with a positive attitude

- Maintaining cleanliness throughout the shift

- Performing end-of-shift cleaning, restocking, and cash reconciliation

## Step 3: Specify the Required Skills

 Having defined the responsibilities, you need to outline the relevant skills a bartender requires to succeed in your establishment.

 The key is to highlight skills pertinent to the role and your bar’s operation rather than using a generic template.

 **Your goal is to detail essential and advantageous skills that align with the realities of the job — not just wishes.**

 **1. Align skills with responsibilities**

 Review each listed duty asking:

- “What skill is needed to perform this effectively?”

- Examples:

- Accurate drink mixing → requires precision and a solid knowledge of standard cocktail recipesCommunicating with customers → needs strong interpersonal and communication skillsEnd-of-shift reconciliation → analytical skill in handling cash accurately

- **2. Differentiate must-have and preferred skills**

- Must-have skills

- These are non-negotiable; candidates must have these skills from the outset.

- Nice-to-have skills

- These are advantageous but not critical; they can be developed over time.

- **Consider these common skill areas:**

- Mixology proficiency and understanding of common drink recipesSpeed and multitasking during high-volume periodsExceptional customer service and a friendly dispositionBasic math for managing tabs and cash registersHygiene standards and cleanliness maintenanceAdaptability in fast-paced environmentsTeam collaboration and communication

- Only include skills based on your specific operational needs.

- **Example for a specialised cocktail bar**

- Must-Have Skills

- Extensive knowledge of classic and modern cocktail recipesAbility to prepare cocktails to high standards quicklyStrong interpersonal skills for engaging with upscale customersCompetence in using POS systems to process sales

- Nice-to-Have Skills

- Experience with seasonal menus or creating signature drinksInterest in spirits and cocktail innovationCapability to mentor junior bartenders

- **Example for a busy sports bar**

- Must-Have Skills

- Ability to mix drinks quickly and accurately during busy periodsExperience operating tap systems efficientlyExceptional customer service in a high-energy environmentGood numeracy skills for handling cash and managing tabs

- Nice-to-Have Skills

- Previous experience in high-volume bar settingsKnowledge of craft beers and local brewsFlexibility in shift scheduling and covering

- Step 4: Define the Level of Experience Required

- Having listed the necessary skills, it’s crucial to specify the level of experience required. This step helps filter out mismatched applications and sets clear expectations.

- Requesting more experience than necessary is a common error that might deter viable candidates. If training can be offered, note this to attract candidates eager to learn and grow.

- **Your goal is to state the required experience clearly — not merely in years, but also the kind of environment familiarity needed.**

- **1. Determine if the role is entry-level, mid-level, or senior**

- Entry-level: Open to those with minimal experience but eager to learn.Mid-level: Must have practical, hands-on experience similar to your type of bar.Senior: Requires extensive experience, readiness to lead, or train others.

- Avoid mislabeling roles as “senior” when you merely seek reliability; it might lead to paying inadequately for the expectations set.

- **2. Emphasise type of experience over years**

- Instead of merely stating “X years’ experience,” specify the setting:

- Should they have experience in a high-turnover, fast-paced environment?Can they handle manual bartending using traditional tools?Have they worked in a similar service style, whether bar-focused or mixing table service?

- Clarify — 3 years at an automated drink dispensary does not equal a year behind the bar at a high-end cocktail lounge.

- **3. Explain if training support is available**

- If you offer training, communicate this; if full competency is expected from day one, highlight it too.

- **Example for a mid-level bartender**

- "Seeking an individual with at least 1 year of hands-on bartending experience, familiar with a high-energy service setup. Sound knowledge of cocktail preparations using premium spirits and the ability to handle bar operations seamlessly during peak hours are required. We provide periodic training to support continuous skill enhancement."

- **Example for entry-level or a trainee-focused venue**

- "No professional bartending experience is strictly necessary, but you must show eagerness to learn and a passion for great service and drinks. We offer comprehensive training in mixology, techniques, and bar operations."

- **Example for a senior bartender role**

- "Applicants should have at least 2 years’ experience in a fast-paced, upscale bar environment with confidence in high-volume cocktail service, leading shifts and mentoring junior team members. Prior experience in stock management and independent operations is a plus."

- Step 5: Focus on the Personality and Cultural Fit Required

- While skills are vital, the right personality makes a bartender shine in your establishment. This section of the job description lets you seek candidates whose personal attributes match your team’s essence and venue culture.

- Beware of falling into the trap of vague clichés like “hard-working” or “friendly” — they provide minimal insight.

- **Your goal is to specify the attributes and working style that mesh well with your team and establishment.**

- **1. Evaluate what works with your existing team**

- Consider:

- What do your top team members share in common?Which personalities tend to thrive less in your environment?Is your team’s energy vibrant and fast-paced or calm yet efficient?Do customer interactions lean towards lively and social or more professional and brief?

- List critical adjectives that encapsulate the spirit you want in your team.

- **2. Be Specific to Avoid Generic Descriptions**

- Steer clear of terms like “team player” — explain what this means practically, such as:

- “Spots when a co-worker needs help and jumps in without asking”“Communicates expectations clearly during busy rush periods”“Remembers and engages regulars by name to cultivate loyalty”

- **3. Align Personality with Job Pressure Levels**

- For high-energy, bustling bars: someone who’s steady under stress and prioritises efficiency is ideal.For a slower, more customer orientation: someone sociable, empathetic, and hospitable would excel.

- **Example for a vibrant sports bar**

- "You’ll fit in perfectly if you’re energetic, resilient in busy settings, and enthusiastic about sports culture. Our team values clear communication during peak times and a collaborative spirit during smooth operations. We need someone who thrives in lively environments and embraces a hands-on attitude."

- **Example for a premium cocktail lounge**

- "This role suits someone fluent in both mixology and conversation. You should have a knack for understanding customer preferences and suggesting cocktails confidently. A penchant for elegance, consistency, and a cooperative team spirit are crucial in providing a premium experience."

- **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask current staff: “Who do you look forward to working with and why?”Reflect on past hires that didn’t work — what mismatch occurred?Stand by authenticity. If your venue is hectic, highlight the need for composure and adaptability.

- Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

- Where many hospitality job ads fall silent, transparency about compensation can be your biggest asset. Candidates greatly value knowing what salary and benefits they can expect upfront — it can make or break their interest in the role.

- Being open not only about salary but also about work perks builds trust and encourages more appropriate applications.

- **Clearly state:**

- The pay rate or anticipated rangeAdditional benefits or incentivesAny standout reasons to work with you

- **1. Be direct about compensation — is it hourly or salaried?**

- Link to specific figures, individual rates, or expected ranges. If you’re unsure:

- Benchmark using sites like Indeed or local hospitality job boards.Assess your expectations — are they targeting entry-level, standard, or senior roles?If dependent on experience, outline a range.

- Example:

£10.00–£11.50 per hour, subject to experience  
£11.00/hour + share of tips, revisavble after 90 days probation period
- Avoid non-specific references like “competitive pay” — candidates find this off-putting.

- **2. Detail any staff benefits**

- Highlight additional advantages such as:

- Discounted or complimentary meals and drinksBreak payments or professional developmentClear tip-sharing systemsStaff gatherings or outingsMental health initiatives or employee assistancePredictable schedules or flexibilityPaid annual leave, especially if above statutory minimums

- Example:

- Free meals and drinks post-shiftPaid leave exceeding statutory requirementsProfit from in-house or external trainingEqual tip distribution among staffRegular team-building activities and events

- **3. Highlight advancement opportunities (if any)**

- If you offer mentorship, experiential learning, or potential career advancements, express this.

- Example:

- We support personal growth through tailored on-site training, optional industry certifications, and advancement pathways to senior roles or management positions.

- **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**
Compensation: £10.50–£12.00 per hour determined by experience  
Tips: Equitably distributed monthly among the team  
Perks:
- No-cost meals during shifts30 days annual leave (including bank holidays)Half-hour remunerated rest periodsAccessible in-house skill development coursesRegular social events and outingsPredictable schedules and minimal late shifts

- **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Consider: “What aspects would retain someone long-term in this role?”Truth over embellishment — transparent limitations earn more respect than exaggerated promises.Emphasise non-monetary advantages if pay scales are modest (work-life balance, organisational culture, skill-building opportunities, etc.).

- What's next

- After solidifying your Bartender job description, prepare for recruitment by framing targeted Bartender interview questions and practical work assessments.&nbsp;

 Examples:

- Communicating with customers → needs strong interpersonal and communication skills

- End-of-shift reconciliation → analytical skill in handling cash accurately
