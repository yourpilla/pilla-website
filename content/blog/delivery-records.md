title: How to Set Up Food Delivery Checks
tldr: >-
  - Ingredients should be traceable in case of a food borne illness, an allergic
  reaction, foreign body or chemical contamination incident. Without proper
  traceability, your can't notify the relevant supplier and they can't be
  investigated by the local authority to check if the source of the problem is
  traced back to them.

  - Your food suppliers must carry out their own due diligence in their supply
  chains and must have robust food safety management systems and HACCP
  procedures in place.&nbsp;It is good practice to work with food suppliers who
  have external accreditations such as the British retail consortium (BRC) and
  safe and local supplier approval (SALSA). These suppliers will have had to
  undertake very strict audits to obtain their accreditations.

  - Incoming food deliveries should be checked to make sure they have been
  transported properly and the quality is high.&nbsp;Pilla has a pre-built food
  delivery temperature check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff
  to record compliant checks including delivery vehicle temperature and
  condition.

  - You should aim to record all high risk deliveries such as meats. Set up
  enough daily recurring food delivery checks so that your teams can do
  this.&nbsp;
