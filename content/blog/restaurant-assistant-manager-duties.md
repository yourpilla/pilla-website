 ## Step 1: Begin with Your Restaurant's Atmosphere and Introduction

 Setting the scene for your restaurant in your job description is crucial. Offer insights into your establishment's atmosphere to provide candidates with an authentic feel for your workplace. Even if you are defining this for existing members of your team, it acts as a reminder of your core values and experience you want to maintain.

 **Your goal is to convey:**

- The type of establishment and culinary theme

- Service model and daily pace

- The cultural ethos and environment

 Use this simple 3-part structure:

 **1. Define your establishment type:**

 Introduce your restaurant briefly: “We are a family-run Italian eatery / an upscale fusion restaurant / a bustling tapas bar...”

 **2. Highlight your service model:**

 Characterise your dining service approach. For example:

- “We aim for a relaxed, conversational dining experience with a high emphasis on personalised service.”

- “Our focus is a quick turnover with efficient service and consistent quality.”

- “We offer full-service dining with seasoned staff and a refined ambience.”

 **3. Express what’s unique about your team or culture:**

 This could be about your management style, sustainability practices, or collaborative environment. Consider:

- “We foster a nurturing atmosphere where every voice is heard.”

- “Our menu features organic, locally-sourced ingredients.”

- “We hold monthly training sessions to foster career growth.”

- “Our aim is innovative cuisine with sustainability practices.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

 Consider answering these questions to define your restaurant succinctly:

- What is a typical shift like at your restaurant?

- How many covers do you serve per service?

- Do you provide a casual or formal dining experience?

- How would you describe the dynamics of your team?

- What do your staff enjoy most about working with you?

 You’re portraying an honest picture of what working in your restaurant is like.

 **Example 1: Casual dining restaurant**

 We are a full-service, casual seafood restaurant near the river. We seat 150 covers and focus on offering a cheerful, beachy atmosphere. Our teamwork is integral; we support local fishing and adhere to eco-friendly practices.

 **Example 2: Fine dining experience**

 We operate a full-service, fine dining French restaurant. Our venue seats 75 and provides an elegant, detailed service. We painstakingly ensure a perfect balance of innovation and classic techniques in our dishes. Our team is passionate about the art of refined service and traditional culinary methods.

 ## Step 2: Highlight Key Responsibilities for the Restaurant Assistant Manager

 When detailing responsibilities, avoid being overly vague or mimicking another venue's list. Tailor duties to align with your daily restaurant operations and objectives.

 **Your goal is to craft a list that genuinely mirrors your business operations.**

 Provide a breakdown of 6–10 key responsibilities across different operational phases:

 **1. Administrative and Operational Responsibilities**

 Tasks concerning daily management and operational support:

 Ask yourself:

- What admin tasks need to be performed daily to ensure a smooth operation?

- What systems or processes need regular oversight?

 Common examples:

- Coordinate and oversee restaurant operations during scheduled shifts

- Ensure daily restaurant checks to maintain full compliance with health and safety standards

- Monitor cost control and inventory management

- Handle vendor communications and order supplies

 **2. Staff Management Responsibilities**

 These tasks relate to leading and organising the team.

 Ask yourself:

- How does the Assistant Manager support staff management?

- What role do they play in developing team members?

 Common examples:

- Lead and motivate the team to achieve service excellence

- Organise and manage shift schedules and staff rotas

- Assist in recruiting, training, and developing team members

- Conduct regular team briefings or meetings to enhance communication and morale

 **3. Customer Service and Front-of-House Responsibilities**

 Focused tasks directly impacting guest experience.

 Ask yourself:

- How does the Assistant Manager enhance dining experiences for guests?

- What is their involvement in handling customer feedback or issues?

 Common examples:

- Ensure high standards of customer service are consistently upheld

- Address and resolve any guest complaints promptly

- Oversight of restaurant setup and closure operations

- Create a welcoming and pleasant environment for all guests

 **If you already have Assistant Managers but haven't formalised their duties, consider:**

- Obtaining Input from Current Managers: Inquire about their daily responsibilities

- Consult with the Restaurant GM: Gain insights into expected management duties

- Review Rota and Shift Plans: Identifying shifts or tasks requiring special focus

 Useful questions to ask your Assistant Managers:

- What are your key achievements during shift management?

- What challenges do you often encounter, and how do you manage them?

- What role do you play in staff training or development?

- How do you ensure excellent guest service during busy periods?

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Shadow a current restaurant manager to observe daily tasks

- Review operational guidelines or shift procedures for inspiration

- Identify areas that require more consistency or better management and include them

 **Example for a mid-sized neighbourhood bistro**

 As a Restaurant Assistant Manager, your responsibilities will include:

- Overseeing operational needs during scheduled shifts and addressing issues efficiently

- Directing staff to maintain consistent service quality and guest satisfaction

- Designing and implementing comprehensive staff training programs

- Maintaining inventory levels and cost controls

- Providing a hands-on approach to day-to-day restaurant management

 **Example for a high-volume city restaurant**

 As a Restaurant Assistant Manager, your responsibilities will include:

- Coordination of a structured, efficient workflow during peak hours

- Working with management to uphold food safety standards and compliance

- Supporting team dynamics and encouraging a productive work culture

- Managing and grooming talent through robust evaluation and feedback sessions

- Handling escalated guest concerns, ensuring expeditious and positive resolutions

 ## Step 3: Define What Skills the Role Requires

 Having outlined the responsibilities, it's vital to identify key skills necessary for the Assistant Manager role. This helps candidates self-reflect and ensures you receive applications from those who match your needs.

 **Your goal is to create a precise list of skills based on your defined expectations.**

 **1. Reflect on responsibilities**

 For each task, decide: “What skill is essential for accomplishing this successfully?”

 Example:

- For managing safety compliance → knowledge of food safety regulations

- For leading the front-of-house team → leadership and communication skills

- For resolving guest complaints → effective problem-solving skills

 **2. Create a list divided into two parts:**

- **Must-have skills:** These are essential from day one.

- **Nice-to-have skills:** Skills that are beneficial but not essential.

 **Consider key skill areas:**

- Strong organisational abilities

- Effective verbal and written communication

- Leadership and team development skills

- Knowledge of restaurant management software

- Solid understanding of financial management

- Conflict resolution and guest complaints management

- Adherence to health and safety regulations

- Inventory management proficiency

 Focus on what's needed for your specific restaurant setup.

 **Example for a focus on customer service:**

 **Must-Have Skills**

- Experience in team leadership and staff supervision in a restaurant setting

- Strong problem-solving abilities and customer service skills

- Ability to effectively communicate with diverse staff and clientele

- Operational knowledge of food safety and health regulations

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Familiarity with POS system management

- Experience with staff scheduling and rostering software

- Proficiency in basic bookkeeping and financial report preparation

 **Example for a high-paced urban restaurant:**

 **Must-Have Skills**

- Proven ability to lead and inspire in a fast-paced environment

- Conflict management and resolution capabilities

- Strong organisational and multitasking abilities

- Adherence to and thorough understanding of sanitation standards

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Previous experience with inventory and cost control

- Experience in special event and function coordination

- Skills in developing and delivering staff training initiatives

 By laying out the necessary skills, you refine the selection process to attract fitting candidates who can thrive in your restaurant's unique environment.

 ## Step 4: Specify the Experience Level Needed

 Specifying the appropriate level of experience helps align candidate expectations and reduces mismatched applications. Be strategic in defining what real-world experience is essential versus desired.

 **Your goal is to outline the appropriate level of experience needed for the role you are offering.**

 **1. Determine if this role is suitable for a graduate, experienced professional, or seasoned manager:**

- **Entry-level:** Suitable for those with some supervisory experience, but seeking deeper management exposure.

- **Mid-level:** Ideal for professionals with prior assistant management or lead supervisory experience.

- **Senior level:** Requires seasoned management skills able to function autonomously and lead operations when needed.

 Accurately assess what your restaurant requires. Don’t label it 'senior' unless truly needed, which avoids mismatching skills and expectations.

 **2. Focus on work experience specifics rather than years alone:**

 Instead of stating “2 years' experience,” describe the context: 

- Should candidates have experience handling high-volume dining settings?

- Is leadership experience in settings with a particular dining style mandatory?

- Do they need financial management experience?

 Being specific about the required experience helps in getting quality applications.

 **3. Mention available training or development opportunities (if applicable):**

 If you offer support or opportunities for role advancement, make it clear. For example: "Coaching on leadership skills is available for those looking to transition to more senior roles."

 **Example for a mid-level role:**

 "We are seeking someone with at least two years' experience in a supervisory or assistant management capacity within a restaurant. Familiarity with managing front-of-house operations, staff supervision, and service delivery is essential. We value leadership growth and provide continuous opportunities for advancement."

 **Example for entry-level management:**

 "This role is perfect for those with minimal managerial experience but possessing excellent leadership potential and work ethic. Some supervising experience and a passion for restaurant service are all that’s required—we provide initial support and ongoing training."

 **Example for an experienced assistant manager:**

 "A minimum of three years management experience in a full-service establishment is required. Proven ability in restaurant operations, team mentorship, and guest service management is vital. Experience overseeing financial tasks and knowledge of industry performance metrics is a plus."

 ## Step 5: Specify Personality and Culture Fit

 While skills and experience matter, hiring an individual whose personal qualities complement your team culture is essential for a successful working relationship. Tailor this section to reflect the genuine attributes needed to excel in your restaurant.

 Avoid vague phrases like "team player" or "motivated." Describe genuine traits and behaviours that resonate with your restaurant’s values, dynamics, and expectations:

 **Your goal is to detail the attitudes and interpersonal qualities which suit your establishment’s ethos.**

 **1. Assess what’s currently working well with your team:**

 Questions to consider:

- What common traits do your strongest team members share?

- What kind of personalities fit into the existing team dynamics seamlessly?

- Does the team cherish autonomy, collaboration, or innovation more?

- What style of customer interaction is a hallmark of your service?

 Jot down words or phrases that describe desirable energy in your leadership team.

 **2. Provide clear examples rather than abstractions:**

 Avoid: "motivated leader" — instead, say:

- “Proactively engages with staff, planning daily schedules effectively.”

- “Seeks innovative approaches to streamline operations.”

- “Communicates openly with both team members and guests.”

 **3. Match the desired personality to the pressure and pace of the role:**

- If demanding and high-paced, seek resilience and composure under pressure.

- If relaxed yet attentive, seek warmth and careful attention to detail.

 **Example for a fine dining restaurant:**

 "You will thrive if you possess a composed, organised demeanour with a focus on precision. Excellent communication and the ability to maintain calm under pressure are critical, given our meticulous service standards and fine dining expectations. A subtle yet warm approach complements our team." 

 **Example for a casual, community-focused café:**

 "Bring a sense of enthusiasm, friendliness, and warmth to our dynamic team. We’re looking for someone who loves engaging with all walks of life, maintaining genuine curiosity towards local culture and customer stories. Nimbleness and team-oriented mindsets are essential, as we facilitate an inclusive, relaxed environment."

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Ask your team what quality they love most in co-workers

- Recall previous hires who fitted well, and those who didn’t — what was the difference?

- Stay honest — outline attributes truly needed for the challenges and joys of your particular establishment

- Consider the dynamics of communication style – emphasize clear, articulate communication for seamless team and customer interaction.

 ## Step 6: Define Pay and Benefits

 Surprisingly, this is often a neglected area in job descriptions. Potential candidates deserve transparency about their prospective remuneration and benefits. Such clarity shows professionalism and builds trust.

 **Your goals should be:**

- Clearly outline salary or pay range

- Highlight benefits and any noteworthy perks

- Share what distinguishes your working environment

 **1. Clearly convey pay structure — whether salaried or hourly:**

 Present an honest wage rate or realistic range. If you're unsure what to offer:

- Research comparable roles near your location on job boards (Indeed, Caterer, Glassdoor, etc.)

- Consider your role expectations — junior, mid-level, or seasoned managers.

- Provide a clear range when pay depends on experience. Avoid generic phrases like "competitive salary."

 Example:

 £25,000–£28,000 annually based on experience.

 £12.50/hour + potential bonus structure reviewed quarterly.

 **2. Enumerate staff benefits meaningfully:**

 Simple perks can have a lasting impact:

- Complimentary staff meals or discounts

- Paid leave and flexible scheduling options

- Team-building events or funding for professional development

- Health and wellness support programs

- Progression opportunities such as mentorships, certifications, or courses

 Example:

- Staff discounts of 50% on dining

- Generous paid time off

- Optional professional development courses partially funded

- Bi-weekly team events or culinary workshops

- Potential for bonus based on restaurant performance metrics

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £25,000–£30,000 per annum based on experience.
 Benefits:

- Free meals and beverages on shift

- Personal development and career growth courses available

- Flexible work-life balance initiatives

- 28 days of paid holidays including bank holidays

- Quarterly performance bonuses based on goals reached

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Focus on aspects that make staff loyal to your establishment

- Be truthful — honest expectations build goodwill

- If salary is a limiting factor, highlight what makes the role rewarding (learning opportunities, team environment, flexible working hours, career progression)
