# How to Set Up Food Probe Thermometer Checks

 Date modified: 1st June 2025 | This article has been written by Pilla Founder,&nbsp;[Liam Jones](https://yourpilla.com/profile/liam-jones), click to&nbsp;[email Liam directly](mailto:liam@yourpilla.com), he reads every email.

 ## TLDR: About&nbsp;Food Probe Thermometers

 - Food probe thermometers should be used to test all food temperatures before serving. In order to work properly the probes must be tested and maintained.

 - You should test one or two probes per week.&nbsp;Pilla has a pre-built fridge probe accuracy check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff to record compliant checks.
- Each probe should be tested in hot and cold water using the methods described below. A correct reading for hot water test should be&nbsp;100°C and a correct reading for cold water test should be&nbsp;0°C.

  ## Preparing the Probe for Testing&nbsp;

 Before we get into the calibration process we need to prepare the thermometer. The probe, the very tip that touches our food, must be spotless, free from any residue that could skew the reading. This pre-calibration step is not just about cleanliness; it’s about getting a successful calibration - so the readings we rely on are not clouded by the remnants of previous uses.
 A thorough inspection of the thermometer is essential, even the slightest damage can render the readings unreliable. A bent probe, a cracked display or a foggy interior - these are the warning signs that need to be addressed before you proceed. 

 Here’s how to clean and sanitise it:

 1. Wash the probe with warm soapy water to remove any dirt or debris.

 2. Rinse the probe with clean water to remove any soap residue.

 3. Sanitise the probe with alcohol swabs or bleach solution to kill any remaining germs or allergens.

 This double process of cleaning and sanitising is not just about hygiene; it’s a preventative measure. It stops the transfer of unwanted visitors from one food to another, so when the probe goes into the next culinary creation it’s pure and precise.

 Look for signs of wear and tear: cracks, chips and any damage that could affect the readings. It’s also a chance to check the probe is straight and true, not bent or damaged from mishaps or misadventures, as even slight damage can cause big errors.The scale of the thermometer should be clear, no leaks or foggy interior. This inspection phase confirms not only the cleanliness of our thermometer but also its structure, ready for the calibration process to come.

 ## Hot Testing of Probe Thermometer

 This simple but precise process involves submerging the probe in boiling water - a substance with a known temperature. The hot calibration is a proof that our thermometer can report the high temperatures we need in the kitchen. It’s a method that gives us confidence that our cooking instruments are calibrated to identify the heat.

  Boiling water setup and hot calibration

 1. Choose a suitable pot.&nbsp;The depth of the pot is important, so the probe can be fully immersed without hitting the bottom or sides of the pot.

 2. Fill the pot with boiling water

 3. Submerge the probe at least 2 inches deep, not touching the sides or bottom of the pot to avoid false readings. 

 4. Wait for the thermometer to stabilise, the temperature must remain static for at least ten seconds before taking a reading. 

 5. Once the reading stabilises it should show 100°C (212°F) - the boiling point at sea level. The reading is allowed a deviation of 1 degree centigrade in either direction i.e. -1° or + 1°c.

 ## Cold Testing of Probe Thermometer

 This method uses an ice water bath, a stable substance that hovers at the freezing point. The cold calibration is a test of the thermometer’s ability to capture the lower end of the temperature spectrum.
But the ice bath method, also known as the freezing point method, requires more care than boiling water.  Although simpler, the ice water bath must be prepared with precision so the temperature it offers for calibration is an exact reflection of the freezing point.

 1. Fill a vessel with crushed ice

 2. Add just enough water to cover the top of the ice so it floats

 3. Let it sit to stabilise temperature

 4. This will give you minimal temperature variation and a consistent 0°C (32°F) for calibration after a short while. 

 5. Once the ice bath is ready submerge the probe, careful not to touch the ice cubes directly. Stir gently to keep the temperature even throughout the bath.
