title: How to Set Up Food Probe Thermometer Checks
tldr: >-
  - Food probe thermometers should be used to test all food temperatures before
  serving. In order to work properly the probes must be tested and maintained.

  - You should test one or two probes per week.&nbsp;Pilla has a pre-built
  fridge probe accuracy check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff
  to record compliant checks.

  - Each probe should be tested in hot and cold water using the methods
  described below. A correct reading for hot water test should be&nbsp;100°C and
  a correct reading for cold water test should be&nbsp;0°C.
