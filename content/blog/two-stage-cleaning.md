title: Using a two stage cleaning process in hospitality and retail.

Two stage cleaning is used to ensure that harmful microorganisms removed during the cleaning process. A two stage clean means cleaning staff should first physically remove food residues then use a second stage of disinfection.
It is also recommended that before applying a product to remove food residues, firstly, gross contamination is wiped off using single use disposable centrefeed roll (blue roll), then a chemical to remove food residues is applied. For heavy contamination, a food grade hard surface cleaner/degreaser should be used first, for very light contamination, the sanitiser can be initially applied and used as a hard surface cleaner. These chemicals should be washed/cleaned off with a clean cloth.

 After food residues have been physically removed, disinfection can now take place by applying the sanitiser for the correct contact time. If sanitiser has been used for the initial cleaning stage, it must now be reapplied as a disinfecting agent.

 Always follow manufacturerâ€™s instructions regarding the need to rinse sanitisers or not.

 Allow surface to air dry. It is very important that no standing water remains on surfaces as moisture will provide a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.
