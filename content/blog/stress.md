  - Stress Risk Assessments are crucial for maintaining a supportive work environment. They are mandatory under Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (as amended in 2003 and 2006)
- You&nbsp;should carry out a stress at work risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is protected. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built stress at work risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. Are Staff Able to Cope with the Demands of Their Jobs?

 This section focuses on whether your team can manage their workload within the hours they’re scheduled to work. Consider factors such as:

 - Shift lengths – Are shifts overly long, or clustered to minimise breaks during peak service times?
- Workload – Is the volume of work reasonable during different times, especially during peak hours?
- Breaks – Are people given enough rest time during their shifts?
- Training – Are employees adequately trained for all aspects of their roles?

 **Why it matters:**

 Excessive workloads and insufficient breaks lead to mental fatigue and decreased performance. In hospitality, this can quickly lead to service slowdown, mistakes, and increased accidents or injuries. Ensuring employees are capable of handling the expectations of their roles is crucial for both safety and service quality.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A strong answer explains:

 - How workloads are assessed and balanced throughout the day
- What systems are in place to ensure fair distribution of tasks
- How often staff get breaks, and for how long
- How training needs are identified and addressed

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “Shift patterns are designed around predicted customer flow, ensuring even distribution of staff throughout the day. Most team members work 8-hour shifts with two 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute meal break. We regularly conduct workload assessments, adjusting staffing levels during peak times to prevent overwork. All new staff undergo a three-day training programme covering core tasks before starting on the floor.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Review your current operations:

 - Look at shift rosters to ensure breaks are possible and achieved
- Speak to team leaders to understand peak hour strains
- Check who is responsible for training and check follow-up on gaps

 **Tip:** Regularly solicit direct feedback from staff about workload and break adequacy.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We schedule breaks, but staff often skip them during busy times.”  That’s a sign that breaks are not effectively managed — revised strategies might be needed. “Everyone just has to push through busy periods.”  
This leads to decreased morale and burnout. Strategy planning for rush hours and unforeseen events ahead of time can help tackle this issue. “Staff always know what to do, so training isn’t formalised.”  
Even experienced staff can struggle if expectations aren't clear or training isn't applied equally. ## 2. Do Staff Have Any Control Over How They Do Their Work?

 This section deals with how much autonomy staff have when completing tasks. Lack of control is a common stress factor and impacts job satisfaction. Think about:

 - Do staff have a say in how rotas are organised?
- Can they influence their daily tasks or service routines?
- Do they have the freedom to manage their responsibilities their way?

 **Why it matters:**

 Having some degree of control over their work helps employees feel more valued and empowered. It also increases job satisfaction and reduces work-related stress.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Strong responses describe:

 - How staff can give feedback on rotas
- Whether they have specific areas they prefer working in
- Whether they collaborate in shaping service routines
- How flexible management is with staff-suggested improvements

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “We have a monthly rota meeting where team members can discuss preferences or issues regarding shifts. Staff can give input on their daily tasks and adjustments are made to reflect individual strengths. Suggestions on service improvement can be submitted anonymously for group consideration.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Is there a forum for staff to give feedback on rotas or tasks?
- Do current systems allow innovation, or are staff bound to strict routines?
- Can you provide examples of past adjustments based on staff feedback?

 **Tip:** Implement a simple suggestion process for sharing ideas or improvements.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Staff don’t need input; rotas are fixed.”
Unyielding schedules can escalate stress due to limited flexibility. “They’ve never asked for change.”
Not everyone will come forward unless the environment is welcoming and encouraged for feedback. ## 3. Do Staff Feel Supported by Management and Colleagues?

 This focuses on whether your team feels they can count on their leaders and peers. This includes:

 - Handling of problems – Can staff raise issues openly? How are these managed?
- Access to guidance – Is managerial guidance routinely available, and do staff feel listened to and valued?
- Induction and integration – Do new staff get a thorough introduction to their role and team?

 **Why it matters:**

 A supportive work environment fosters collaboration and emotional resilience. Lack of support can lead to persistent stress and decreased morale.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Good responses outline:

 - The systems in place for issue resolution
- How management encourages feedback and offers support
- What welcome and induction practices apply to new staff

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “Our open-door policy ensures any team member can speak with a manager about work-related issues without a set appointment. Weekly check-ins provide opportunities for personal development discussions. New starters receive a documented induction pack and are paired with a buddy during their first month.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Check:

 - What’s the formal process for raising problems?
- How is manager-staff communication structured for continuity?
- What integration practices do you have?

 **Tip:** Ninety percent of stress is related to feeling unsupported. Encourage openness and regular feedback.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We assume communication is happening.”
Assumptions can lead to missed opportunities for support. “New staff are shown around their first day.”
That’s a start, not the full programme. Aim for continual support. ## 4. Are Working Relationships Positive and Respectful?

 This section looks at the dynamics within your team. Key points to consider include:

 - Is there a culture of communication and respect?
- Have any incidents of bullying or cliques been addressed?
- Is teamwork actively encouraged and maintained?

 **Why it matters:**

 Positive workplace relationships enhance job satisfaction and mitigate stress. Conflicts or poor communication lead to tension and can escalate quickly in a fast-paced environment.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Good answers cover:

 - Whether there’s a respect culture between all team levels
- How interpersonal issues are resolved
- Any team-building practices or campaigns in place

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “We operate using a Respect Code of Conduct available for all employees. Monthly cross-team workshops create opportunities for sharing best practices and building trust. Any issues of disrespect or bullying are addressed immediately, with support from HR.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider:

 - How are issues raised and addressed?
- Do you have clear policies for behaviour expectations?
- Is team-building a regular agenda item?

 **Tip:** Promote activities that foster good relationships beyond formal meetings.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We assume bullying isn’t taking place.”
Don’t assume — regularly ask for feedback and monitor interactions. “We focus only on work, not relationships.”
Work and relationships often intertwine; both need management. ## 5. Do Staff Understand Their Role Clearly?

 This focuses on whether staff have clarity about what they’re supposed to do. Consider:

 - Are job roles and expectations clearly communicated?
- Do staff know the scope of their duties?
- Are responsibilities clearly demarcated?

 **Why it matters:**

 Uncertainty leads to mistakes and stress. Clearly defined roles promote confidence and efficiency, and prevent overlaps that can lead to conflicts.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Strong answers should explain:

 - How roles are defined
- Whether responsibilities conflict or overlap with others
- If role descriptions are up to date

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “Each team member has a job description reviewed annually. Clear handover protocols exist between shifts to ensure continuity and understanding. Any role changes are clearly communicated and documented in both digital records and staff meetings.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Are responsibilities documented and periodically reviewed?
- Is there a process to update roles or address overlaps?
- How aware are staff of duties outside their regular tasks?

 **Tip:** Communicate any changes in duties or roles promptly to prevent confusion and stress.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Roles are not documented as they are usually obvious.”
Assumption leads to confusion. Written definitions are critical. “Changes to duties aren’t always communicated.”
Lack of communication is a quick road to stress and misunderstanding. ## 6. Are Staff Kept Informed About Changes at Work?

 This section checks whether team members are updated about changes in the workplace, from shift patterns to new menu items. Key points include:

 - Communication of changes – Are staff kept in the loop with operational or management changes?
- Timeliness of updates – Is information shared quickly and clearly?

 **Why it matters:**

 Poor communication about changes in work can lead to uncertainty and anxiety. Keeping employees informed reassures them and prevents rumours or misinformation from spreading.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Strong answers reveal:

 - The processes for announcing changes to teams
- Whether there is a standardised communication platform (e.g. company intranet)
- How feedback is gathered post-changes

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “Any changes in rotas, menus, or policies are communicated via our company intranet and followed up in weekly team huddles. Feedback is solicited after changes go live, and adjustments are made if necessary.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are staff briefed on changes before they happen?
- What mediums do you use for communication?
- Is feedback actively encouraged after a change?

 **Tip:** Use multiple communication channels to ensure messages reach all team members.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Changes are told on the day they occur.”
Staff need time to adjust — give as much notice as possible. “We just post changes on the notice board.”
Relying on one method misses those who aren’t present. Use varied methods for wider reach. ## 7. What Actions Will You Take to Reduce Stress Risks?

 After identifying the potential stressors, plan actions to mitigate those risks. This section should capture your action plan, including immediate and longer-term strategies.

 **Why it matters:**

 An actionable plan shows that you are committed to improving staff wellbeing. It helps structure your efforts and ensures follow-through on commitments to reduce stress.

 The section should be structured as a clear list of practical steps you will take: 

 - Check workloads during peak hours and adjust staffing levels where needed
- Improve break planning to ensure everyone gets rest
- Create a rota feedback process so staff can raise issues early
- Hold monthly team meetings to review wellbeing and listen to feedback
- Add a confidential way for staff to report problems or stress-related issues
- Ensure role descriptions are up to date and new staff are clearly briefed
- Plan and communicate changes with plenty of notice

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Reflect on each earlier section to ensure no points have been missed. Identify short-term changes you can implement quickly, as well as long-term goals. Assign responsibility for each action and consider how you’ll communicate progress.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We’re too busy for changes right now.”
Start small — even simple changes can reduce stress significantly. “We’ve listed actions, but not the people responsible.”
Specify who’s responsible for each step to avoid inaction. ## 8. How Will You Monitor and Review Stress Levels?

 It’s essential to regularly check whether your actions are making a difference and if your plan needs updating. Think about the following:

 - Responsibility – Who’s in charge of monitoring and review?
- Follow-up – How will you check that actions are taken and effective?
- Tools – Will you use surveys, 1-to-1s, or other methods to gauge success?

 **Why it matters:**

 Regular monitoring and reviews ensure lasting change. This helps to identify if any stressors have been overlooked and if actions are working, fostering a continuous improvement loop.

 **What good answers look like:**

 A strong answer includes:

 - How monitoring is conducted (e.g. regular surveys)
- Who oversees this process
- Any specific review targets or timeline
- Feedback processes for staff to share insights

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 “The General Manager is responsible for stress monitoring, conducting bi-annual employee satisfaction surveys and quarterly 1-to-1 check-ins. Team leaders will gather daily observations and input from staff. A summary review meeting occurs every six months.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Who tracks stress levels in your workplace?
- What measures are currently in place for staff feedback?
- Are there routine reviews of stress reduction effectiveness?

 **Tip:** Use digital solutions like employee feedback apps or online surveys to facilitate continuous feedback.

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We assume actions are working.”
Assumptions lead to unaddressed issues. Confirm with data and direct feedback. “Feedback is given informally, not consistently.”
Implement structured feedback mechanisms for reliability and consistency. **Best practices to follow:**

 - Establish a clear feedback loop for staff to raise concerns
- Use a variety of methods to gather feedback (surveys, meetings, digital tools)
- Assign a dedicated person or team to oversee reviews and actions
- Set regular review intervals to keep stress management a priority
- Clearly communicate improvements and next steps to your team
