# An interview with an Environmental Health Officers (EHOs): Everything You Need To Know

 Date modified: 1st April 2025 | The below is a guest article written by ex-Council EHO and Food Safety Expert, [Natalie Stanton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliestantoneho/). We asked Natalie to tell us more about what an EHO actually is and what the role entails so we can be prepared for inspections

 ## TLDR;

 - Environmental Health Officers in the UK work directly for the local authority and carry out unannounced inspections on hospitality businesses.
- These inspections are to judge the level of food safety against the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme. The Officer will provide every businesses with a score 0-5 which displays the businesses level of food safety.
- During the inspections, EHO will look at food processes, building condition and management processes. They are looking to see that a business has a [food safety management system ](https://yourpilla.com/blog/food-safety-management-system)and is carrying out daily due diligence checks.
- EHOs can arrive at anytime and have powers which range from making suggestions to closing your business but they do not have the power to arrest anybody.&nbsp;

 Hospitality businesses have a responsibility to protect their guests from harm. One of the biggest risks to customers is poor food safety practices and this is the very thing which Environmental Health Officers work to reduce.
You implement a food safety management system system which aims to ensure the safety of your guests (including preventing food poisoning) but as you will recognise in hospitality, things can go wrong. EHOs, like me, play in important role in protecting the health of the public. Working with them is beneficial and can help to ensure high standards of food safety in your business.Let's dive in and learn a bit more about EHOs, including their duties, powers and training. I'm an EHO and I spent 11 years working for local authorities, so I'll also share some of my insights with you too.

 ## What does an Environmental Health Officer do?

 Environmental Health Officers are employed by local authorities. Their job roles are varied and include checking that your business is complying with food safety laws and producing food that is safe to eat, also providing advice to help you comply with food safety laws.
To ensure public health, central government delegates powers down to local authorities to enforce certain regulations and ensure public health. Your business may be visited by an Environmental Health Officer or an Environmental Health Technician. An Environmental Health Technician is also able to enforce certain food safety laws and inspect most types of food premises, but generally, they do not have the same level of powers and qualifications as an EHO. You may find Environmental Health Technicians with other job titles including Food Safety Officer and Food Safety Specialist.

 ## A typical week in the life of an EHO

 A typical week for me when working in local government looked like this:
 - Conducting inspections of different types of food premises to check they are complying with food safety law and regulations. Restaurants, cafes, takeaways, hotels, hospitals, schools, care homes, nurseries, food manufacturers, home bakers, you name it. There are so many different types of food businesses and the majority are inspected by EHOs. For many of these inspections, I would also score the business and give them a Food Hygiene Rating.
- Responding to and where necessary investigating complaints and infectious disease notifications. The complaints could range from food poisoning allegations or mouldy foods to poor standards or pests seen in food businesses. I have to be honest, I've dealt with some seriously weird and wonderful complaints over the years. Sometimes these investigations involve working with other organisations and government agencies such as the Police, fire service and HMRC.
- Admin! Let's face it we all have to do admin. This would normally involve putting inspections onto the database and writing letters to businesses where remedial works were required.Now, I have to caveat this section, because no two days (or weeks) were ever the same. Literally anything could happen and your whole week could change just like that!

 ## What training has an Environmental health officer done?

 It takes many years to qualify as an EHO. The normal route is to undertake a BSc or MSc in Environmental Health. Then complete professional exams, a work placement (often with a local authority) and a portfolio to demonstrate competence.
EHOs also undertake continuing professional development and training courses to maintain their competence. Real-life example:I did an MSc in Environmental Health which is a postgraduate course and a practical food inspection course and exam. Then a 1 years training placement with a local authority whereby I shadowed other officers and completed a portfolio that totalled 86 reports! I then passed a professional interview and exam before finally qualifying as an EHO!The route to qualification is always changing, so if you want to know more, I would recommend checking out the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health website.

 ## What format does an EHO follow when inspecting a food business?

 When inspecting businesses, Environmental Health Officers use the format laid out in a document called The Food Law Code of Practice. This includes an assessment of 3 key areas. It's these same 3 areas that the officer assess to determine a food hygiene rating.
 1. Food safety and hygiene: 

 - How food is stored
- How food is handled and prepared including cooking, displaying food, cooling and reheating
- Personal hygiene practices (such as correct hand washing procedures)
- How cross-contamination is controlled

 2. Structure and cleaning:

 - The cleanliness and condition of the structure of the kitchen and food preparation rooms
- The cleanliness and condition of equipment
- Pest control methods
- Waste control
- General standard of cleaning
- Layout of the premises and food rooms
- Lighting and ventilation
- Facilities for washing hands and sinks
- Water supply and drainage

 3. Confidence in management:

 - Relevant food safety management system that is implemented in practice
- Appropriate monitoring of critical control points (temperature control records, for example)
- Staff training records
- Other relevant records such as pest control, waste control, invoices/ receipts.
- Accurate allergen information and correct allergen labelling
- Assessing confidence in the management and the business owner

 Real-life example: I like to start by looking at a business's food safety management system. I want understand what it says so that I can check it's being followed in practice. For example; if the food safety management systems states that fridge temperatures are checked twice a day, I will then check the records and see if this is happening.

 The number of records I will look at is determined by what I find. For example; if temperature records don't look like they're being completed regularly, then I will look at a lot more. Whereas, if I have confidence in the records I see, I may only look at 1-2 weeks worth.

 ## What powers does an Environmental Health Officer have?

 EHOs have many powers. Let's explore the main ones.
 - Entry to premises at any reasonable time: Environmental Health Officers have the&nbsp;power or right of entry. They can enter at "any reasonable time". This is normally the hours that your business is operating. This means that if you are open and they require entry to carry out an inspection, you must allow them entry to all areas of your premises.&nbsp;
- To investigate complaints: If an EHO receives a complaint about food or a food poisoning allegation they may visit your business to investigate further.&nbsp;
- Take samples: EHOs can take samples. For example; of food and food contact materials and surfaces. The main reason an officer may take samples is if they have reason to believe offences have been committed and they may require the samples as evidence. They may also take samples to have them analysed in a lab i.e. to look for bacteria or other relevant organisms.&nbsp;
- Seizure of foods and other items: An EHO has powers to seize and detain food that they determine to be unfit for human consumption. They can also have the food destroyed. They may also seize other items such as equipment and packaging if they consider an offence has been committed.&nbsp;
- Take photographs as evidence of non-compliance: Whilst on the premises, Environmental Health Officers have the right to take photographic and video evidence. This evidence may be used as evidence in any future court procedures. Alternatively, the officer may just take photos to put into a report to highlight to you any remedial works you need to do. So don't panic straight away if you see them taking photos!
- Seizure of documentation for further analysis: An Environmental Health Officer may remove any paperwork and records to evaluate later, this includes your food safety management system or paperwork.
- Question staff and take statements: Finally, an Environmental Health Officer may also speak to or ask questions of any staff member. This is normal as part of a food hygiene inspection, so don't panic.However, they can also take statements from staff members if they suspect offences have been committed.

 Importantly, An Environmental Health Officer does not have the power to arrest anybody.

 ## When do EHOs have the right of entry?

 An Environmental Health Officer has the right to enter your premises at all reasonable hours. The Environmental Health Officer does not need to give you prior notice, unless your business runs from your home, in which case you should be given at least 24 hours’ notice.
If the Environmental Health Officer is refused entry to the premises, has a reason to believe they will be refused entry, they can apply for a warrant through a magistrate and enter with the Police who can use reasonable force. During an environmental health officer visit, they should do a few things:

 - Always show identification before beginning an inspection.&nbsp;
- Give clear feedback once the inspection is complete in order for the food premises to improve food safety immediately
- Explain any actions taken or intended actions and provide explanations in writing&nbsp;
- Explain any breaches in food safety in writing&nbsp;
- State the time limit for carrying out remedial works. This should be set out in the report of letter following your inspection.
- Explain your rights of appeal for any action taken

 ## Which legal notices can be served by an environmental health officer?

 - Hygiene Improvement Notice

A Hygiene Improvement Notice may be served where there is a record of non-compliance with the law. The purpose is to place a legal requirement on a Food Business Operator to take action to achieve compliance. The notice would clearly state what is wrong and why, the action that needs to be taken to comply and the timescale for compliance (not less than 14 days). An example would be repairing cracked floor tiles or implementing a HACCP system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice

Legal notices of this type mean that the EHO intends to apply to the Magistrates court to stop your business from trading to protect public health. If the Order is approved by the magistrate, your food business cannot operate until the Environmental Health Officer considers the risk mitigated.A Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice may be served where there are more serious breaches of the law and where there is a real and imminent risk of injury to public health. 

For example a severe pest infestation. The notice would stop the use of an entire premises, part of the premises or a specific activity or piece of equipment.The EHO will then apply to the Magistrates court to get the notice turned into an Order. If the Order is approved by the magistrate, your food business cannot operate until the Environmental Health Officer considers the risk mitigated.FAQs
