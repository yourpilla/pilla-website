# Using a two stage cleaning process in hospitality and retail.

 Two stage cleaning is used to ensure that harmful microorganisms removed during the cleaning process. A two stage clean means cleaning staff should first physically remove food residues then use a second stage of disinfection.
It is also recommended that before applying a product to remove food residues, firstly, gross contamination is wiped off using single use disposable centrefeed roll (blue roll), then a chemical to remove food residues is applied. For heavy contamination, a food grade hard surface cleaner/degreaser should be used first, for very light contamination, the sanitiser can be initially applied and used as a hard surface cleaner. These chemicals should be washed/cleaned off with a clean cloth.

 After food residues have been physically removed, disinfection can now take place by applying the sanitiser for the correct contact time. If sanitiser has been used for the initial cleaning stage, it must now be reapplied as a disinfecting agent.

 Always follow manufacturerâ€™s instructions regarding the need to rinse sanitisers or not.

 Allow surface to air dry. It is very important that no standing water remains on surfaces as moisture will provide a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.

 ## The importance of two stage cleaning

 Two stage cleaning is used to ensure that harmful microorganisms are reduced to a safe level during the cleaning process. Following this method of cleaning is important in food businesses. Two stage cleaning means cleaning staff should first physically remove dirt and food residues with a detergent then use a second stage to disinfect. It is vital that dirt, grease and loose debris are removed first. This is because the presence of dirt and debris can actually reduce the effectiveness of a disinfectant or sanitiser.
It is also recommended that before applying a product to remove residues, gross contamination is wiped off using single use disposable centrefeed roll (blue roll) and then a chemical to remove residues is applied. For heavy contamination such as grease build up, a food grade hard surface cleaner/degreaser should be used first. For very light contamination, the sanitiser can be initially applied and used as a hard surface cleaner. Generally, these chemicals should be washed/cleaned off with a clean cloth or disposable blue roll.

 After dirt and residues have been physically removed, disinfection can take place by applying the sanitiser for the recommended contact time. The recommended contact time is determined by the manufacturer. If sanitiser has been used for the initial cleaning stage, it must now be reapplied as a disinfecting agent.Some sanitisers or disinfectants can be left to air dry on a surface. Others may require wiping or rinsing off with a clean cloth or disposable blue roll. It is vital to refer to the manufacturer's instructions.

 It is important that no standing water remains on surfaces as moisture could provide a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.When doing food hygiene inspections and audits, I would often ask a staff member to describe, or even demonstrate how they clean a work surface. One of the things I'm looking to see is, is that the staff member is aware of and follows the two stage cleaning process.

 ## Cross-contamination 

 Cross-contamination is when harmful bacteria transfer from a raw food source, such as raw meat or vegetables to ready-to-eat food. This is a common cause of food poisoning.
This can be direct, i.e. raw meat directly touching ready-to-eat food. Another example would be raw meat juices dripping onto ready-to-eat foods. I've actually witnessed raw meat juices on the top of a ready-to-eat yoghurt-based dip in a hospitality business fridge!It can also be indirect. For example, harmful pathogens transferring via equipment, surfaces or hands that have previously touched raw foods.Effective cleaning and disinfection is extremely important to reduce the risk of cross-contamination and prevent harmful bacteria from remaining on surfaces and equipment. ## Using a sanitiser as part of two stage cleaning process

 - Staff instructions 
You should communicate as many instructions as possible so that you're staff know when and how to use two stage cleaning. On the Pilla app for example, you can add instructions to each cleaning item on your cleaning schedule checklist. So if you want to use a certain method of two stage cleaning, then add a text description and an example image. If you don't use Pilla (which is free by the way), consider how you can instruct your staff to use the exact method of cleaning that you want them to.When using a sanitiser or disinfectant as part of two stage cleaning there are a number of things to consider in relation to these chemical products. This includes compliance with the relevant standards, the contact time and dilution requirements. These are all things that EHO's such as myself, check during inspections in relation to cleaning. I suggest that you check you have these in place, before the EHO does! BS EN1276 &amp; BS EN 13697

 Where businesses handle or prepare raw and ready-to-eat food, surfaces and equipment must be cleaned and disinfected between uses. Chemical disinfectants used in these areas must comply with either BS EN 1276 or BS EN 13697. This is something that the Environmental Health Officer (EHO) will check.As an EHO, it gives me a lot of confidence if a business owner and their staff are aware of these British Standards and if they can confidently demonstrate that their sanitiser complies. If you are sure whether your sanitiser meets the required standard, check this with your supplier or the manufacturer. Definitely do this before your inspection!

 The contact time is the amount of time that a sanitiser or disinfectant must be left on a surface to work effectively. They don't kill bacteria instantly, instead, the chemical needs time on the surface to effectively reduce bacteria to a safe level.

 As an EHO, I would expect all food handling staff, as part of their job, to have received training in contact times and it is a question I regularly ask staff during an inspection or audit.

 Some sanitisers or disinfectants require dilution. It is therefore important to refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the 'dilution rate'. This will tell you the quantity of water to mix with the concentrated chemical.It is essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the dilution rate. If you don't, then the sanitiser may be too strong and could cause chemical contamination of food. Alternatively, it will be too weak and it will not work. If this happens you will just be wasting money.

 Again, as an EHO, this is something I would check during an inspection or audit. I would expect to find that staff who as part of their job must dilute a concentrated sanitiser, to be able to explain the correct method for doing this.
