 Vacuum packed cooked foods can have their normal shelf life extended by using this method.

 Vacuum packed raw food use by date will not change.

 Vacuum packing food involves the removal of air from packaging that the food has been contained in under an airtight seal. However, this process can increase the risk to the food from anaerobic organisms, particularly clostridium botulinum and listeria monocytogenes, both of which are psychrotrophic organisms i.e. Capable of multiplication at low temperatures.

 Consequently, very strict controls must be exercised to avoid contamination, multiplication, spore and toxin formation.

 For more information see food standards agency website.

 ## Raw materials

 Only fresh produce must be used for this process, do not use leftovers or food close to its use by date. Foods used near to their use by date increase the risks.

 ## Work areas

 The processes involved in vacuum packing must be restricted to highly trained staff only.

 All knives and boards used in this area must be cleaned and disinfected through the dishwasher at 82°c before use.

 ## Handling

 Staff must wash hands thoroughly before handling any vacuum packs, food, knives, boards and equipment within the process.

 ## Packing machinery

 Vacuum packing machinery must be proactively maintained by a competent person in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, kept in good running order and kept meticulously clean and disinfected. Records of maintenance and regular checks must be kept.

 Faulty or unmaintained equipment may not seal vacuum pouches correctly, creating serious risks.

 ## Separation of equipment

 Separate vacuum packing equipment must be used for raw and cooked products.

 Each vacuum packer must be labelled clearly as to its usage.

 Each vacuum packer must be sited in designated separated areas to avoid cross contamination risk.

 ## Vacuum pack pouches / bags

 Only bags that are assured to be suitable for vacuum packing food must be used purchased from a reputable supplier.

 Manufacturer’s instructions should be followed strictly.

 Vacuum packaged bags must be visually checked to ensure that they are fully sealed and that their does not appear to be any air in the bag.

 Food that have been vacuum packed must be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures not exceeding 5°c.

 ## Sealing

 The food must be suitably and sufficiently sealed to ensure the packaging integrity is not affected; this is essential to ensure the gaseous atmosphere of the sealed package is maintained throughout the storage process.

 ## Use by dates

 Provided that cooked vacuum-packed foods are kept under robust storage conditions and kept refrigerated at a temperature between 3-5°c. Not exceeding 5°c at any time, then they may be given a maximum shelf life of 10 days.

 If vacuum packed food is found to be outside of the range 3-5°c, then it must be used within 4 hours.

 If vacuum packed food is unwrapped for the purposes of portioning or slicing, it must not be vacuum packed a second time or the shelf life must not be extended beyond the shelf life of the original product.

 Note: when vacuum packed products are used as ingredients within other products, the shelf life date must not be extended beyond the original shelf life date of the original product for the new product, unless it has received a treatment that is sufficient to kill or stop the growth of harmful bacteria.

 ## Cleaning of machinery

 It is essential that vacuum packing machinery, both for raw and for cooked products, are cleaned and disinfected thoroughly using suitable food grade degreaser/hard surface cleaner and a suitable sanitizer/disinfectant.

 Machines must be cleaned in between and after use to prevent cross contamination from the equipment user to other products.

 ## Corrective actions

 Retrain staff who use vacuum packers if correct methodology and procedures are breached.

 Assess and monitor training needs of staff, paying special attention to returning previously ill staff.

 Check correct delivery of products as per order and specification.

 Delivery of products intended for vacuum packing, if delivered above 5°c, reject stock.

 Discard products above 5°c or beyond use by date.

 Review cleaning methodology and procedures and staff training in these procedures.

 Ensure that machinery is regularly checked and maintained.

 If food is mislabelled, a senior manager should consider discarding the food.

 Food that has been cross contaminated or suspected as cross contaminated must be discarded.

 Improve and increase supervision if staff not fully competent in vacuum packing procedures or methodology.

 ## Record keeping

 Record and contraventions of the above safety points.

 Record any corrective actions taken.

 Keep records of maintenance, checks and repairs to vacuum packing machinery.

 Keep records of training and/or retraining of staff.
