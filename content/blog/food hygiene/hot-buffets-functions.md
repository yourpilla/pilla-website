 Poor handling and storage procedures when holding functions and buffets can lead to food borne illness. Temperature control and contamination controls need to be robust.

 Staff must follow the safety points below in order to maintain a consistent level of food safety.

 ## Chilled storage

 Prior to display for a function or buffet ensure that foods are kept under strict temperature control until immediately before service, that is, chilled, frozen or held hot.

 ## Temperature

 Hot foods to be placed on display for functions or buffets must have been cooked to a minimum of 75째c and then held hot above 63째c prior to placement on display.

 It is advisable to keep hot foods hot if possible, by the use of a bain-marie or a hot counter.

 Foods kept hot for display are at less risk of spore germination and bacteria multiplying and producing toxins.

 ## Time

 Hot foods on display have a maximum shelf life of 2 hours once temperature falls below 63째c any one time. After this the food could be unsafe so must be discarded.

 ## Preparation

 A common cause of food poisoning is when food has been prepared too far in advance of serving where there may not be adequate space to store the food safely until the time it is consumed.

 Food should be prepared in the morning for afternoon service and prepared in the afternoon for evening service, or immediately prior to service if this is possible.

 ## Covering food

 Foods should be covered at all times, especially immediately prior to service and during service if possible. Use lidded containers, cling film and tin foil where required.

 Ensure display units and cabinets are fitted with sneeze guards.

 Ensure foods are protected from airborne contaminants, allergens, flies, people coughing and sneezing by taking appropriate control measures.

 ## Protection

 Keep doors and windows closed to avoid pest ingress. Fit fly screens and ensure doors are proofed by fitting door closers.

 ## Customer removal of food

 Although it is not encouraged, occasionally customers wish to remove food for consumption off the premises, if this cannot be avoided then customers must sign the company disclaimer, which absolves the company of responsibility for the safety of the food once removed from the premises.

 ## Food provision by the customer

 If customers wish to provide their own food for a function or employ the services of an outside caterer, they must sign the company disclaimer absolving the company of responsibility for food safety in regard to their guests.

 ## Corrective actions if things go wrong

 - Re-organise the storage space or arrange for extra or alternative storage facilities if space is lacking for prepared buffets and functions.
- Repair or replace any hot holding equipment that is faulty or broken down.
- Change your methods or set up of the kitchen to ensure that separated areas are used.
- Use alternative methods of display if cross contamination is an issue.
- Cross contaminated foods must be discarded.
- Discard foods that have dropped below 63째c after a period of no longer than 2 hours.
- If staff do not follow the safety points above, then retrain them and increase supervision until competency can be shown.
