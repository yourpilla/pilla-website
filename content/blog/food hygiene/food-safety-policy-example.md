 ## How to Write Your Own Food Safety Policy Statement

 Your food safety policy statement is a short document that shows your commitment to keeping food safe. It sets out how your business will manage food hygiene risks, meet legal requirements, and protect customers from illness or injury. It’s the foundation of your food safety management system (FSMS) and a key part of running a compliant food business.

 **Why your business needs one**

 The law says you must take “all reasonable precautions” and show “due diligence” to avoid food safety incidents. Having a clear written policy helps you prove this to inspectors and more importantly, helps your team understand exactly what’s expected of them.

 A good policy:

 - Sets a clear direction for your hygiene procedures
- Gives new starters a solid understanding of your standards
- Helps staff understand the “why” behind what they do
- Acts as a reference point when creating checklists and training plans

 **Who is it for?**

 It’s written by owners, directors, or senior managers—but it’s for everyone. All staff should understand what it says. New starters should read it during induction, and managers should refer back to it when reviewing procedures or training.

 When should you write or update it?

 - When setting up your food safety system
- When you take over a new site or kitchen
- When your menu or processes change
- After a food safety complaint or incident
- At least once a year

 Here’s a simple structure you can follow, with tips for what to include in each part.

 **1. Start with a strong commitment**

 Open with a clear, confident statement. Say that your business is committed to delivering the highest standards of food safety and meeting all legal requirements.

 Example:
“Our business is committed to ensuring the highest standards of food hygiene and safety at all times. We will do everything reasonably possible to prevent harm to our customers and maintain full legal compliance.” **2. Describe how you manage risks**

 Explain how you identify and control food safety risks. Mention your aim to remove hazards where possible, or control them if they can’t be eliminated.

 Example:
“We will identify all potential food safety hazards in our operations. Where we can eliminate a hazard, we will. Where we can’t, we will control the risk as far as reasonably practicable using robust procedures and monitoring.” **3. Explain your staff training and supervision**

 Say how you will ensure your team is trained, supervised, and supported to carry out food handling safely.

 Example:
“All food handlers will be given appropriate training, supervision, and resources to follow safe procedures. This includes training in key food safety risks, personal hygiene, allergen control, cleaning and disinfection, and safe food handling.” **4. Show your commitment to HACCP**

 Make it clear that you use a HACCP-based food safety system. Mention the main steps you monitor (e.g. storage, cooking, cooling, reheating) and that you follow the 7 HACCP principles.

 Example:
“We use a HACCP-based food safety management system to manage risks throughout the food preparation process. Staff are trained to monitor critical control points and understand safe limits, corrective actions, and record-keeping.” **5. Mention your supporting systems**

 List the “prerequisite” systems that support your HACCP plan. These are things like cleaning schedules, pest control, supplier checks, and waste management.

 Example:
“We maintain a strong foundation of supporting procedures, including cleaning and disinfection routines, pest control, staff hygiene policies, approved suppliers, and traceability systems.” **6. Explain how you review the system**

 Finish by saying how and when you’ll review your policy and food safety system - typically every year or after major changes or incidents.

 Example:
“We will review our food safety policy and management system at least once a year, or sooner if there is a significant operational change, food complaint, or incident.” **Final tips**

 - Keep it short - 1 to 2 pages is enough.
- Avoid jargon. Use clear, simple language.
- Make sure your policy matches your real practices.
- Display or store it somewhere easy to find.
- Train your team to understand what it means in practice.
