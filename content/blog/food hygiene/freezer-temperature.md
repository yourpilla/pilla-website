 ## TLDR:&nbsp;About Freezer Temperature Checks

 - Freezer's temperature is an important factor in maintaining the quality and safety of frozen food. The ideal freezer temperature is -18°C (0°F) or below or colder.

 - Freezing foods to a minimum of -18°C ensures that all bacterial activity ceases, both pathogenic and spoilage organisms are rendered dormant. Higher temperatures above -15°C will allow spoilage organisms to start multiplying very slowly. Food not stored correctly at -18°C or colder will undergo spoilage affecting the food's quality.
- You should check and record the temperature of every freezer unit twice per day.&nbsp;Pilla has a pre-built fridge temperature check inside which includes all of the  inputs for staff to record compliant checks.

 - If anything goes wrong such as a freezer breakdown, highlight the issue using the using 'Issue' button and follow the corrective actions below. Record everything that you do as a post inside the freezer temperature check so you are create a full digital paper-trail of compliance.
