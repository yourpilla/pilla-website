  Day 1: Set the Foundation: Make your expectations clear from the start. Cover hygiene, team culture, and basic coffee knowledge. This first day is about confidence, not caffeine.

  Day 2: Teach Espresso and Milk: Get hands-on with grind size, shot timing, and milk texture. Focus on habits, not speed — and explain why each step matters.

  Day 3: Expand Skills and Menu Knowledge: Introduce latte art, signature drinks, and alternative milks. Teach recipe flexibility and reinforce visual standards with drills and side-by-side comparisons.

  Day 4: Customer Service and POS: Train your team to handle guests, special requests, and the till under pressure. Prioritise multitasking, allergy responses, and consistent service tone.

  Day 5: Safety, Quality Control, and Readiness Check: Wrap with practical health and safety, drink quality checks, deep cleaning, and a final review. Confirm they’re confident and consistent before going solo.

## Day 1. Foundations and Coffee Knowledge

 Your onboarding should start by answering one key question:
“What does every new barista need to understand before they touch a machine?” This phase is about orientation, safety, and basic coffee literacy. Done well, it builds confidence, prevents early mistakes, and helps new hires feel like part of the team from day one.

 **Orientation and First Impressions**

 Why it matters:The first few hours shape how new hires feel about your business — whether it’s organised, welcoming, and serious about standards. What to include:

   ElementInstructionsNotes  Team IntroductionPersonally introduce the new barista to team members, ideally with a shift buddy assigned.Assign someone confident and patient as their buddy for the week.  Venue TourShow front and back of house: stock areas, fridge layout, cleaning zones, emergency exits.Emphasise where to find support, not just where things are stored.  Expectations &amp; House RulesWalk through appearance standards, shift routines, lateness policy, break rules, etc.Use a printed one-pager they can keep.  Who to Ask for WhatClarify reporting lines and point people for each area (e.g. maintenance, rota, supplier issues).This reduces hesitation and builds trust early.   
   
   **Hygiene, Safety, and Clean Working Habits**

 Why it matters:
The fastest way to lose confidence in a new hire is if they don’t follow hygiene basics — and the fastest way for them to feel overwhelmed is to learn the rules only after breaking them. What to cover:

 - Food hygiene basics: handwashing, allergen awareness, date labelling, storage rules, clean vs dirty cloths.
- Safety essentials: how to handle hot jugs, sharp equipment, slippery floors, and what to do in an emergency.
- Daily habits: show them where cleaning supplies are, and explain when and how to clean as they go.

 Manager Tip:
Demonstrate the why behind your rules. For example: “We don’t reuse milk jugs not just for hygiene, but because overheated milk changes the texture of the next drink.” 

**Coffee Literacy (Without Overload)**

 Why it matters:
Baristas shouldn’t just make drinks — they should understand them. A basic grasp of coffee origins and taste builds curiosity, pride, and upselling ability later on. How to structure this section:

   ConceptTraining ContentTeaching Format  Origins &amp; FlavourWhere your coffee is from, what roast style it is, what it tastes like.Brew and taste with them if possible. Ask what they notice.  Drink TypesGo through your drink menu, with visual examples or a recipe sheet.Cover drink volumes, espresso ratios, milk texture expectations.  House PhilosophyDo you aim for consistency? Speed? Artistry? Hospitality? Clarify this early.Use examples: “For us, a perfect drink is hot, quick, and cleanly poured — latte art is a bonus.”   **Questions to Help Build This Section in Your Own Venue**

 - What first impressions do I want to give about our standards?
- What hygiene or safety rules cause the most confusion with new hires?
- What coffee values do I want every team member to carry forward?
- What’s the minimum product knowledge a new barista needs to take pride in their work?

 ## Day 2. Espressos and Milk

 This section focuses on building the core technical skills every barista needs — pulling espresso and steaming milk. These two elements are the foundation of your entire drinks menu, so it's worth taking the time to build proper technique.

 Rather than rushing straight to drink recipes, this stage should be about building muscle memory, good habits, and visual judgement.

 **Espresso – Teach by Feel, Not Just by Numbers**

 Why it matters:
Espresso is temperamental. Machines vary. Beans change. Good baristas don’t just follow steps — they learn to read the espresso. Break it down into teachable parts:

   StepWhat to TeachKey Details  Grind SizeShow how fine/coarse changes the flow rate.Let them pull two shots side-by-side with different grinds.  DosingTeach how much coffee goes in — by weight if possible, or using consistent levelling technique.Use scales if you can, but also train visual cues.  TampingEmphasise consistency and evenness over brute force.Let them try tamping with a level checker.  Shot TimingShow how long a shot should take and what under vs over-extracted shots look/taste like.Give them targets: e.g. “Between 25–30 seconds, with a steady flow and even crema.”   Manager Tip:
Pull bad shots on purpose and ask them to diagnose what went wrong — this builds pattern recognition fast. **Milk – Texture Before Art**

 Why it matters:
Most of your menu depends on milk quality. Teaching proper milk handling upfront prevents waste, poor drinks, and burnt fingers. Train in layers:

   Focus AreaWhat to CoverTeaching Tips  Jug SizeTeach when to use small vs large jugs depending on the drink.Label jugs by size and purpose (e.g. dairy vs oat milk).  Steaming TechniqueTrain hand position, angle, depth, and what the milk should sound like.“Listen for a light paper-tearing hiss, not a scream.”  TemperatureTeach both hand-feel and thermometer usage.Stop steaming at 60–65°C (milk heats a little more after).  CleaningWipe and purge the wand every time — non-negotiable.Set a cultural standard here — enforce it early.   Practice Drill:
Line up 5 cups of steamed milk, each with different texture. Ask them to taste or touch and match to drink types (e.g. cappuccino vs flat white). **Part C: Putting It Together – Simple Drink Practice**

 Start with the basics before complicating things. Focus on building consistency, not speed. Quality comes before pace.

 Suggested first drinks to practise:

 - Espresso (shot only) — assess timing and crema
- Americano — test dilution control and order of pour
- Flat white — for texture control and steady pour
- Latte — helps practise higher milk volume and temperature balance
- Cappuccino — good to train on foam control and contrast

 Have them make each drink multiple times and compare the results with you.

 **Questions to Help Build This Section in Your Own Venue**

 - What espresso standards do we expect here (shot time, yield, taste)?
- Do we weigh shots and doses, or rely on visual cues?
- What milk textures match each drink on our menu?
- How strict are we with alternative milks — are there different techniques needed?
- What are the top 5 drinks every barista must be able to make consistently before serving guests?

 Bonus Tip:
Don’t just teach technique — teach why it matters. For example:
“We care about 27-second shots because they create the best balance between sweetness and strength for our roast profile.” ## Day 3. Latte Art and Menu Expansion

 Once a new barista has gets the hang of basic espresso and milk techniques, it’s time to expand their range — both in terms of visual presentation (latte art) and menu knowledge. This step turns technical competence into confidence and creativity.

 But don’t jump straight to tulips. Instead, focus on building steady hands, milk texture consistency, and an understanding of why drink variation matters for service.

 **Teach the Building Blocks of Latte Art**

 Why it matters:
Latte art is more than aesthetics — it reflects control over milk texture, espresso quality, and pouring technique. It’s a great tool to teach finesse. Start slow and structure it:

   Focus AreaWhat to TeachTips to Reinforce  Milk Quality FirstRemind them latte art is impossible without the right microfoam.Practise steaming just milk again if the texture is off.  Pitcher PositioningTeach how jug angle and height affect pour speed and shape.Use slow-motion videos to explain visually.  Pour ControlStart with a central dot, then progress to heart, rosetta, and tulip.Use water in jugs to practise pour speed without wasting milk.  Body MechanicsShow how elbow height and wrist movement affect steadiness.Encourage them to pour over a sink to reduce tension and waste.   Training Drill:
Have them pour 10 hearts on a tray of test lattes. Ask: Which is most symmetrical? Which has the best contrast? Discuss together. **Add Confidence With Signature and Seasonal Drinks**

 Why it matters:
Specialty drinks differentiate your café. More importantly, knowing how to make them without flinching under pressure builds real confidence. Build a training list based on your actual menu:

   CategoryDrink ExamplesWhat to Teach  Signature Drinkse.g. spiced latte, honey flat whiteRecipe, portioning, prep steps, and how to communicate ingredients to customers  Seasonal Specialse.g. iced matcha, holiday mochasHow to batch components (if needed) and stay consistent with presentation  Common Customisationse.g. half-caff oat cappuccinoHow to modify drinks without disrupting service flow   Manager Tip:
Have a “Signature Drink Card” behind the bar with recipes and serving notes. Encourage baristas to reference it during training. **Train on Alternative Milks — Don’t Assume They Know**

 Why it matters:
Non-dairy options now make up a huge share of coffee orders. But every alternative milk behaves differently — and poor steaming leads to split or sour drinks. Give them a clear comparison:

   MilkSteaming TipsBest for  OatCan over-expand easily, needs gentle aeration.Flat whites, lattes.  AlmondSplits easily when overheated.Iced lattes, mochas.  SoyHigh foam but can curdle with espresso.Cappuccinos, macchiatos.  CoconutLow stretch — focus on flavour over foam.Iced drinks, flavoured lattes.   Practice Drill:
Have trainees steam and taste each milk type side-by-side. Ask:
“Which one stretches easiest?” “Which works best with our roast?”
This builds both technical and product confidence. **Teach Size and Recipe Adjustments**

 Why it matters:
Knowing the recipe for one drink is fine — but understanding how it changes with size, milk type, or modifiers is what makes a barista truly competent. Examples to cover:

 - How does a cappuccino differ between 8oz and 12oz?
- What changes when switching from whole milk to oat milk?
- How much syrup is used in each drink size — and why?

 Create reference guides that staff can use as cheat sheets during their first weeks.

 Training Exercise:
Line up small, medium, and large drinks. Have them explain the key differences in: - Espresso quantity
- Milk volume
- Texture expectations
- Visual appearance

 **Questions to Guide Your Own Onboarding Plan**

 - What are the minimum latte art patterns your team should learn? (e.g. heart, rosetta)
- Which signature or seasonal drinks do you want every new hire to master?
- How many alternative milks do you offer — and do you train each one separately?
- Do you have a cheat sheet or visual drink guide? If not, should you create one?
- Are new baristas confident explaining drinks to customers, or just copying recipes?

 Final Thought:
Don't just teach drinks — teach decisions.
“If this customer asks for oat milk in a flat white, what changes in your technique?”
Empower them to think, not just follow. ## Day 4. Customer Service and POS System Training

 Serving excellent coffee isn’t enough if the customer experience falls short. This stage of onboarding trains your barista to interact confidently with guests, manage the till smoothly, and handle pressure without losing focus.

 This section isn’t about scripts. It’s about creating confident, clear-headed team members who can manage guests, multitask effectively, and represent your venue with pride.

 **Train the Basics of Barista-Level Customer Service**

 Why it matters:
Your baristas are the face of your brand. A guest’s experience is shaped as much by how they’re greeted as by how their coffee tastes. Focus on three practical layers:

   Service ElementWhat to TrainTips for Reinforcement  GreetingSmile, eye contact, friendly tone — even during busy times.Use video examples and let new staff practise with a team member.  ClarityTeach how to speak clearly and confirm orders.“That’s one oat flat white and one banana bread — is that right?”  ConsistencyEvery customer gets the same basic care — regardless of mood or order.Pair with a senior team member and observe 10 customer interactions. Debrief together.   Checklist for new staff:

 - Do I acknowledge the customer within 5 seconds?
- Am I speaking clearly, even when tired?
- Do I check the customer has everything before they leave?

 Teach How to Handle Special Requests Without Stress

 Why it matters:
You want baristas to stay calm and helpful when faced with modifiers, allergies, or tricky customer requests — not freeze up or get defensive. Training Tactics:

 Roleplay common scenarios:
"Can I get that half-caff, extra hot, with oat milk, no foam?"Teach the decision logic behind each modifier:
If the drink becomes weaker with half-caff — should they double the shot? If a drink is “extra hot,” what temp should they aim for?Allergy training (non-negotiable):
Teach a set script for allergy-related questions (e.g., “I’m not 100% sure about cross-contamination, let me check with the manager.”)
 Practice Exercise:
Give them 5 challenging customer requests.
Have them explain how they’d: 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1

 **Train the POS System Live, Not Just By Watching**

 Why it matters:
Speed and accuracy on the till are important — not just to avoid errors, but to reduce queues and ease pressure on the bar. Best practices:

 Create a ‘Training Till Mode’ if possible
Let them practise with fake orders and real buttons.Teach by scenario:
“A regular walks in and wants their usual: large flat white, no milk — go.”Cover the full range of functions:
Splitting bills
Voiding mistakes
Discounts or staff meals
Adding notes (e.g. “extra hot” or “takeaway”)- Splitting bills
- Voiding mistakes
- Discounts or staff meals
- Adding notes (e.g. “extra hot” or “takeaway”)

 Timing Drill:
Get them to enter 10 real menu items in 60 seconds. Can they stay accurate under pressure? **Teach Payment Types and Queue Management**

 Why it matters:
A barista’s ability to calmly handle payments, issue refunds, or explain price changes improves trust and keeps service flowing smoothly. What to include in training:

   TaskKey Learning  Taking card and cash paymentsHow to check totals before processing  Contactless limitsWhat to do when a card is declined  Refunds or voidsWhen to involve a manager  Multi-person ordersHow to split payments and mark receipts clearly   Queue Management Tips:

 - Encourage short, friendly check-ins with waiting guests (e.g. “Thanks for waiting — we’re just catching up now!”).
- Show how to spot and prioritise customers waiting to pay versus those waiting for drinks.
- Practise multitasking at the POS with another barista calling orders behind them.

 Practice Drill:
During onboarding, simulate a busy period:
Have them take 3 orders, run payments, print receipts, and call drink names — while someone else is asking questions beside them. **Teach Opening, Closing, and Handover Procedures**

 Why it matters:
The barista role often includes early opens and late closes. Teach how to take ownership of the environment — not just the till. Tasks to cover clearly:

 Opening duties
Logging into the POS
Setting float
Checking printer paper
Opening blinds/lights/musicClosing duties
Cashing up / printing reports
Cleaning till and bar area
Logging out of systems
Locking up and handover notes- Cashing up / printing reports
- Cleaning till and bar area
- Logging out of systems
- Locking up and handover notes

 Create a laminated checklist:
One for open, one for close — they tick it off daily until it’s second nature. **Questions to Help You Build Your Own Training Plan**

 - How many different modifiers or customisations does your POS allow?
- Who teaches POS and payment training in your venue — and are they consistent?
- Do you have clear steps for allergy response that every barista follows?
- How do you teach queue control and multitasking?
- Do new baristas know what “a great interaction” looks like at your venue?

 Final Tip:
Your baristas represent your business during every transaction.
They need to understand the tools, respect the guests, and stay composed under pressure — and that only happens through hands-on practice and clear expectations. ## Day 5. Full Health &amp; Safety, Quality Control, and Review

 The final stage of onboarding is about setting long-term habits. This is where you embed deeper safety understanding, instil pride in quality, and evaluate whether your new barista is ready to work independently. It’s not just a final test — it’s a chance to reinforce your standards and ensure your training process has worked.

 **Teach Safety from a Practical, Everyday Angle**

 Why it matters:
Hospitality venues are full of risks: hot steam, slippery floors, allergens, and sharp tools. Baristas must build habits that protect themselves, their team, and your customers — without needing constant reminders. What to teach:

   TopicPractical Training Approach  Burn preventionShow proper handling of steam wands, hot pitchers, and cups. Practise safe stretching of milk without overfilling jugs.  Slip and trip risksDo a short walk-through. Point out high-risk areas (e.g. behind bar during mopping). Teach the rule: clean immediately, sign clearly, check twice.  Allergen awarenessTeach how to avoid cross-contamination. Run through key allergens in your drinks/food. Ensure they know how to respond when asked about allergens (script + escalation process).  Emergency proceduresFire exits, first aiders, and incident reporting. Give them a short quiz to check understanding.  Manual handlingTeach how to lift crates or bins safely. This is often overlooked — but makes a big difference to injury prevention.   Do this: Pair safety topics with a quick demonstration and a scenario:
“What would you do if…” — Then walk them through your expectations step-by-step. **Train Your Quality Control Standards Clearly**

 Why it matters:
Customers won’t tell you if something’s “a bit off” — they’ll just stop coming. Your baristas need to spot issues before the drinks reach the customer. Teach the 3 Core Checks:

 Taste Testing
Show how to evaluate espresso for balance (bitterness, acidity, body).
Let them try good vs. bad shots.
Introduce your preferred flavour profile — e.g. “We prefer balanced acidity, not sharpness.”1. $1
2. $1
3. $1
Visual Inspection
Teach what a great milk texture looks like (no large bubbles).
Check crema thickness, drink presentation, cup cleanliness.4. $1
5. $1
Temperature Checks
Show how to steam milk to the right temperature (ideally ~65°C).
Use a thermometer during training — but also teach feel (hand-on-jug method).6. $1
7. $1

 Tip: Create a short checklist they complete for every drink during training — until standards become instinctive.

 **Train Inventory Awareness and Stock Rotation**

 Why it matters:
Waste eats margin. Poor rotation leads to spoiled milk, stale beans, and rushed reorders. Train them to:

 - Track what’s running low and where stock is kept.
- Use FIFO rotation (First In, First Out) for milk, syrups, pastries.
- Check expiry dates, especially for alternative milks and bottled drinks.
- Spot ordering issues early (e.g. “Only two oat milks left.”)

 Practical training:

 - Give them a simple restock task on day 5.
- Include it in daily close-down routines.
- Show where to find stock sheets (if digital, let them practise inputting).

 Reinforce the logic: You’re not just asking them to stock shelves — you’re training them to protect margin and reduce risk.

 **Reinforce Deep Cleaning and End-of-Shift Sanitation**

 Why it matters:
Cleanliness isn’t just compliance — it directly affects taste, guest perception, and staff morale. Training Essentials:

 - Daily cleaning checklist: espresso machine flush, grinder purge, milk wand soak, floor mop, bin emptying, fridge wipe.
- Weekly or monthly deep cleans: backflush group heads, descale machine, clean behind fridges.
- Hygiene habits: Wash hands after touching bins, switching tasks, using phones, or handling food.

 Visual Aid Tip: Use photos or short videos to show exactly what “clean” means in your venue. A picture of a properly cleaned drip tray is more effective than a bullet point.

 **Wrap-Up Review, Feedback, and Readiness Check**

 Why it matters:
Ending the training week with a structured review makes new staff feel seen — and gives you confidence they’re ready to go solo. Run a Final 1:1 Review Session:

   TopicWhat to Cover  Confidence Check“Which part of the role do you feel most confident about? Least confident?”  Skill ReviewAsk them to explain or demo a coffee drink, a cleaning step, or a till process.  Customer ScenariosRoleplay: difficult guest, slow queue, special request. Watch their reaction.  Give FeedbackBe honest, constructive, and positive. Use specific examples from the week.  Ask for Feedback“Was there anything you found unclear this week?”   Optional Follow-Up Plan:
Set up a check-in after 2 weeks of solo work. Some skills only surface once they’ve been live for a while. 

**Questions to Help You Build Your Own Plan**

 - Do your baristas know your minimum standard for every drink?
- Who’s responsible for training safety and allergens — and is it consistent?
- How do you currently review a new barista’s readiness to work unsupervised?
- Do you use written or visual cleaning checklists?

 Final Tip:
Your onboarding ends here — but their growth doesn’t.
Schedule regular refreshers, reward consistency, and keep the standards alive every week. A strong finish to onboarding lays the foundation for long-term excellence.
