title: How to show food hygiene compliance to inspectors.
intro: >-
  At some point, your hospitality business will be inspected to check it’s
  compliance and general food hygiene standards. If you’re based in the UK, then
  this will happen through an unannounced visit by your local authority and your
  business will be given a public score to reflect how hygienic and safe it is
  for customers.

  The best way to get a good high food hygiene rating from your local authority
  is to constantly use good food hygiene practices and I’ve written other blogs
  on how you can do this. But because the visit is unannounced, at some point,
  an inspector will visit and you won’t have total control over which staff
  members are there to supervise the visit.  That means you need to make sure
  that all your teams know how to demonstrate compliance using Pilla. One of the
  most frustrating things that could happen, is that you are doing all the right
  things and you are actually compliant, but your teams don’t know the best way
  to show an inspector when they arrive, so you get a lower food hygiene rating
  score than you deserve. That’s what this article will help you avoid - it will
  show you all the things that you show an inspector when they arrive on Pilla
  to display your compliance and good hygiene.

## 1. Show your food safety management system

 Often the first thing that an inspector will ask for is your food safety management system (FSMS), or they may call it a HACCP plan or a HACCP system. This is a legal requirement in the UK and it’s really important to make sure you understand what this is. 
Your FSMS is your set of written policies and processes that say why and how you will manage food hygiene.  You’ve got two options for creating a food safety management system. 

 1. If you’re in the UK and you’re not a complex food business (like a fine dining restaurant), you can use Safer Food Better Business (SFBB). The advantage is that it’s the system that the inspector is most familiar with. If you are using SFBB then it is available as a paper based file with hand written notes or a digital file (PDF).
