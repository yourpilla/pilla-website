## Step 1: Begin with Your Restaurant's Atmosphere and Introduce the Venue

 Your job description should start with a clear, inviting description of your restaurant. Giving candidates a sense of your establishment helps them understand whether they are a good match for the role, setting realistic expectations from the get-go.

 **Your aim is to help applicants swiftly grasp:**

- The essence of your establishment.

- The style of service you provide.

- The nature of working in your environment.

 Consider using this 3-part structure:

 **1. What type of restaurant are you?**

 Provide a clear characterization: “We’re a family-run Italian bistro / an upscale modern dining venue / a bustling downtown brunch place…”

 **2. What’s your dining and service style?**

 Capture the rhythm and customer interactions. For example:

- “We serve classic Italian meals with an elegant, attentive dining service.”

- “Our venue offers quick service with a rotating menu for brunch enthusiasts.”

- “We’re a high-turnover restaurant open late with a dedicated focus on hospitality.”

 **3. What makes your establishment unique or appealing to work at?**

 Highlight your team culture, operational nuances, or value propositions. Examples include:

- “We foster a collaborative team where creativity is encouraged.”

- “Our menu highlights locally-sourced ingredients with seasonal variations.”

- “We host regular wine-pairing nights that all staff can suggest ideas for.”

- “Sustainability and eco-friendly practices are core to our ethos.”

 **Tips if you’re struggling**

 If you need help framing this section, converse these questions internally:

- What is a typical service day like in your restaurant?

- How many guests do you typically serve daily?

- How does your team handle service — are they meeting-and-greeting or more reserved?

- Is your kitchen full of creativity or streamlined for efficiency?

- What unique traits make your team stand apart?

 Avoid trying to romanticize your venue. Authenticity will attract the right candidates.

 **Example 1: Upscale restaurant setting**

 We are a chic brunch spot located downtown, known for creative, seasonal menus and inspiring Sunday service with jazz. Our team emphasises quality, precision, and a friendly service style. We work closely with local farmers to ensure fresh produce year-round.

 **Example 2: Family-friendly, casual dining**

 We are a welcoming family-focused restaurant offering traditional Italian comfort food. Our team shares a love for hospitality, creating a familiar atmosphere for regular patrons, and providing an approachable working environment where shared responsibility is key.

## Step 2: Outline Core Managerial Responsibilities

 Generic job descriptions often lack specificity and fail to resonate with real-world dynamics. Move beyond simple phrases like “manage the restaurant” and customise your list to reflect your operation’s genuine needs.

 **Your ambition should be constructing a list that is unique to your operation — not a generic template from somebody else.**

 Compose 6–10 bullet points detailing what the restaurant manager will control in your setting — from the nitty-gritty details of daily operations to team leadership and strategic duties.

 Break it up into clear functional areas, allowing candidates and stakeholders to understand the full spectrum of the role:

 **1. Daily Operations and Oversight**

 Encompass elements that keep day-to-day activities running smoothly.

 Reflect on responsibilities like:

- Who oversees morning preparation, ordering supplies, and ensuring cleanliness?

- How are service standards and quality maintained?

 Typical areas include:

- Leading opening and closing operations, ensuring all protocols are followed.

- Overseeing daily kitchen and dining room cleanliness and organisation.

- Ensuring preparedness for service, from stock levels to staffing.

 **2. Staff Management**

 Address tasks promoting effective team management and morale.

 Consider responsibilities such as:

- Does the manager hire, train, and evaluate team members?

- How is optimal communication facilitated within the team?

 Common examples include:

- Recruiting, training, and supervising staff to ensure high performance.

- Organising rota and staffing to ensure efficient operation.

- Motivating the team in line with restaurant values and culture.

 **3. Financial and Business Management**

 Integrate actions involving the venue’s financial and business health.

 Look into aspects like:

- What financial records need management?

- Are budgeting, inventory, and pricing decisions part of the role?

 Regular tasks include:

- Managing budgets, optimizing costs, and monitoring profitability.

- Overseeing purchasing and inventory management.

- Analysing sales and customer feedback to enhance service.

 **If not documented yet, you can determine tasks by:**

- Observational Learning: Watch how the manager prioritises weekly activities.

- Staff Consultations: Collect feedback on operational dynamics from team members.

- Performance Assessments: Examine past evaluations to pinpoint key responsibilities.

 Consider asking your existing managers:

- How do you orchestrate and monitor daily operations?

- Which tasks ensure team morale and performance remain high?

- Could you describe the financial tracking measures in place?

- How frequently do you engage and resolve customer queries?

 **Tips if you’re unsure**

- Discuss the role with someone currently performing or with first-hand experience.

- Evaluate any existing SOPs or checklists that define daily expectations.

- Consider past challenges and how proactive management would resolve them.

 **Example for a structured, upscale restaurant**

 As a manager, responsibilities consist of:

- Implementing opening and closing routines within company standards.

- Managing staff recruitment, training, and continuous performance assessments.

- Liaising with the head chef to coordinate menu development and execution.

- Implementing efficient rotas and managing labour costs effectively.

- Utilising customer and staff feedback to perpetually elevate service quality.

 **Example for a dynamic, high-turnover restaurant**

 As a manager, responsibilities comprise:

- Leading dynamic teams through effective communication and training strategies.

- Enabling operational excellence via meticulous daily oversight and hands-on interaction.

- Analyzing budgets and daily sales patterns to optimize restaurant performance.

- Sustaining customer satisfaction by resolving inquiries and complaints effectively.

- Offering mentorship and playing a pivotal role in achieving ambitious restaurant objectives.

## Step 3: Define the Skills Your Manager Needs

 Having pinpointed the managerial responsibilities, the next step is to state the skills a manager needs to excel in their role at your restaurant.

 This section helps applicants self-evaluate and reduce the chances of mismatched applications. Similar to responsibilities, keep the focus on skills genuinely required in your setup, avoiding generic checklists.

 **Your objective is to list both essential and desirable skills based on your actual expectations — not an idealistic version.**

 **1. Reflect on the Responsibilities**

 For each task listed, ponder:

 “What skill is crucial to execute this task proficiently?”

 Examples include:

- If managing finances is key → proficiency in budget management is needed.

- If team leadership is involved → excellent communication and motivational skills are required.

- If maintaining service quality is a focus → strong quality assurance and customer focus are crucial.

 **2. Categorise into Must-Have and Nice-to-Have**

- Must-have skills: Integral skills necessary from day one.

- Nice-to-have skills: Beneficial but non-essential skills that can be developed.

 **Explore these skill areas**

- Leadership prowess and strategic guidance.

- Organisational and time management finesse.

- Financial and budget management acumen.

- Sales and marketing strategy development.

- Exceptional customer service and conflict resolution.

- Fostering team morale and collaborative spirit.

- Innovative problem-solving and adaptability.

 Include only the skills relevant to your operation’s structure and culture.

 **Example for a high-end restaurant**

 Must-Have Skills

- Proven leadership skills with a track record in hospitality management.

- Strong financial acumen with experience managing P&amp;L and budgets.

- Exceptional communication and interpersonal skills for guest interactions.

- Ability to evaluate and enhance guest satisfaction consistently.

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Understanding of fine dining service standards and quality control.

- Familiarity with culinary trends and menu development.

- Experience in managing wine lists or beverage programs.

 **Example for a family-friendly, mid-range venue**

 Must-Have Skills

- Capabilities in managing a diverse team of kitchen and front-of-house staff.

- Proficiency in handling operational challenges and resolving conflicts.

- Data-driven mindset for tracking and improving sales and marketing.

- Commitment to fostering an inclusive, welcoming environment for guests.

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Background in community engagement or local partnerships.

- Flexibility to work varied hours, including weekends or events.

- A knack for developing and nurturing client relationships.

 With the roles clarified, you now have the framework to define the necessary skills pivotal to fulfilling each task to a high standard. This ensures your job description attracts the most suitable candidates for your restaurant environment.

## Step 4: Articulate the Needed Experience Level

 Translating skills into practical experience adds leverage to the determination of whether a candidate properly fits into your team dynamics and management expectations.

 Yet, be careful — overshooting experience requirements can deter potential talent, especially those eager and capable learners who thrive under guidance and training.

 **Your goal is to precisely specify the relevant experience essential for your restaurant rather than just citing a generic number of years.**

 **1. Determine the Level of Role: Trainee, Experienced, or Senior**

- Trainee: Openness to nurture someone without managerial experience but with leadership potential.

- Mid-level: Preference for an individual with practical experience in a comparable restaurant context.

- Senior: Looking for someone seasoned in leadership, capable of delivering consistent results and mentoring others.

 Analyse your realistic needs — label the role appropriately instead of inadvertently creating gaps by mismodelled expectations.

 **2. Emphasise Type and Practicability of Experience**

 Go beyond the standard descriptor “X years’ experience.” Articulate the specificities:

 Consider:

- Does prior experience in a fast-paced, high-turnover environment matter?

- Is experience in different food service operations crucial?

- Does the role involve managing diverse service styles (e.g., casual to premium)?

 Ensure precision — a candidate with extensive experience in a general setting differs substantively from someone versed in complex fine dining operations.

 **3. State Training Possibilities or Expectations**

 If you’re willing to provide training, specify any structured programs or development initiatives anticipated alongside the title.

 **Example for mid-level managerial role**

 “We seek a candidate with at least two years of progressive management experience in a bustling restaurant environment with familiarity in coordinating staff and ensuring seamless service. The role promises growth and skill elevation through hands-on leadership and strategic opportunities.”

 **Example for entry-level management**

 “No specific managerial experience is required, though demonstrable leadership skills are vital. We provide comprehensive training modules tailored to bolster your progression alongside immersive management experiences.”

 **Example for a senior manager role**

 “Candidates should possess extensive managerial practice with strategic oversight within high-volume, quality-oriented restaurants. Previous experience nurturing teams, championing compliance, and steering service excellence is advantageous.”

## Step 5: Define Personality and Culture Fit 

 Securing a manager whose values align with your restaurant’s culture is fundamental for long-term success. While skills and experience can be developed, innate personality traits often define harmonious team dynamics and enriched guest experiences.

 Avoid broad benchmarks such as “works well in teams” or “strong communicator.” Candidates need better insights to determine alignment with your venue.

 Instead, accurately reflect the attitudes, energy, and interactive styles that resonate well within your team.

 **Your objective is to outline the behaviours, temperaments, and characteristic styles ideally complementing your specific environment**

 **1. Observe Success Traits in Your Current Team**

 Questions to consider include:

- What shared traits do successful team members exhibit?

- What type of personalities contribute to or disrupt team synergy?

- Is your restaurant’s working culture vibrant and dynamic or steady and methodical?

- Is the customer interaction style generally engaging and conversational or more professional?

 Document these concepts to convey your desired team vibe.

 **2. Illustrate Clearly, Avoid Vague Statements**

 Omit generic language for concrete examples like:

- “Takes initiative in resourcing during unexpected peak periods.”

- “Communicates efficiently while diplomatically settling disputes.”

- “Engages with frequent patrons comfortably, understanding their preferences.”

 **3. Match Personality Requirement to Role Demands**

- If your restaurant is bustling with high energy — look for individuals adept at managing stress and juggling multiple tasks.

- If running a leisurely, guest-centric venue—recruit candidates exuding warmth, empathy, and conversational flair.

 **Example for a fast-paced, dynamic restaurant environment**

 “Ideal candidates demonstrate resilience, positivity, and decisiveness while thriving in energetic surroundings. Our managers cruise through high activity phases by exercising vigilance, adaptability, and spirited team bolstering. We celebrate those who go the extra mile to elevate guest relations and endorsements.”

 **Example for a leisurely, fine-dining restaurant**

 “This role shines among individuals embodying grace, charisma, and decorum in customer relations. Characteristics fostering inclusivity, steadfast resolve, and exceptional communication are cherished. We thrive on professionals dedicated to cultivating a refined dining aura placing guest satisfaction at the forefront.”

 **Guidance if uncertain**

- Inquire with existing stalwarts: “Who embodies our restaurant values superbly?”

- Assume reflections given on past incompatible hires to gauge oversights.

- Spaces with quick turnover? Look for candidates driving composure in hectic spells; avoid those inclined towards mere flexibility without grounding.

## Step 6: Convey Compensation and Benefits

 This segment marks the crucial transparency phase. Potential hires eye clarity into their compensation package beyond just pay in aiding their decision-making process.

 Even if remuneration falls below the apex, honesty on added value, incentives, balance, and working environment are pivotal in the recruitment narrative.

 **Specify:**

- Pay structure — fixed or performance-driven.

- Additional perks or benefits altering candidacy preferences.

- Value propositions distinguishing employment within your restaurant.

>>> PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: “We offer 28 days paid holiday, regular team outings, and a bonus scheme for guest satisfaction. These benefits have helped us retain managers for over three years.”

 **1. Clarify Payment Structure — Hourly or Salaried**

 Disclose concise details of pay. Desist from ambiguity:

- Assess industry standards within contextual relatable comparisons.

- Align payment range framework correlating expectations with competency desired.

- If compensation hinges upon experience, lay plausible ranges.

 Example Statement:

 £28,000–£32,000 annually, performance bonuses considered seasonally

 Evade abstract terminologies such as "competitive salary" lacking context.

 **2. Enumerate Employee Perks and Benefits**

 Peruse avenues beyond monetary components:

- Subsidized meals and occasional time-offs.

- Paid vacations or developmental learning pathways.

- Shared tools acquisition or teamwork ventures.

- Employer-assisted wellness initiatives.

- Flexible schedules honouring work-life equilibrium.

- Elevated leave considerations, particularly exceeding statutory obligations.

 Illustrative Sample:

- Employee-exclusive dining discounts.

- 28-day tenure-aligned annual leave completion.

- Half-pay provision during sanctioned trainings.

- Bi-annual staff outings enhancing camaraderie.

- Late closure mitigations with accrued flexible exertions.

 **3. Emphasize Development Plans and Prospects (Where Relevant)**

 In cases of adopting promising career upliftment initiatives, ensure clear reflections enlighten aspirants.

 Example:

 “Dynamic career progression supported through proactive workshops and industry-recognized leadership modules augmenting continuous individual growth.”

 **Explanatory Section: Compensation &amp; Benefits**

 Compensation: £28,000–£32,000 annually contingent upon delivered milestone assessmentsIncentives: Performance-driven seasonal bonuses considered
Inclusive Benefits: 
- Highly encouraged employee meal advantages.

- Full-spectrum annual leave rights incorporating designated bank holidays.

- Inclusive 20-minute paid break allowance each routine shift.

- Structured education funding aiding advanced role certifications.

- Team activities and interdepartmental social gatherings.

- Advantageous closeures over statutory holiday intervals.

 **Tips for stumped scenarios**

- Reflect: “What core elements usually enhance role appeal?”

- Stand firm on realities — existing limitations must precede exaggerated projections.

- Acknowledging remuneration incapacity? Accentuate favourable working predilections (flexibility, cohesive ethos, comprehensive training, and growth potential).
