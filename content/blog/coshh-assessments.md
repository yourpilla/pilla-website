   - COSHH risk assessments focus on controlling exposure to hazardous substances, ensuring the safety of employees and customers.
- You should have a COSHH inventory at every site which is a live document of all the chemicals that are used. This inventory should identify chemicals which are deemed as hazardous. Only chemicals deemed hazardous require this full risk assessment.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built COSHH risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. What are the routes of exposure with the product?

 Understanding how a chemical can enter the body is crucial because it determines how you should handle it safely. Exposure can occur through:

 - Inhalation: Breathing in vapours, fumes, or dust.
- Skin Absorption: Direct contact with skin.
- Ingestion: Accidental swallowing or consuming food or drink contaminated with residues.

 **Why it matters:** Each route poses different risks and requires unique safety measures. For example, something harmful if inhaled might need ventilation systems, while substances absorbed through the skin might necessitate gloves.

 For each hazardous substance, specify the primary and secondary routes of exposure.

 Example:

 "For [Product Name], the primary route of exposure is skin absorption, especially possible when mixing solutions. Secondary exposure can occur via inhalation during spray application."

 Talk to your staff who use these chemicals daily:

 - How do they generally come into contact with the chemical?
- Have there been any past incidents of exposure you can learn from?

 Check the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the suppliers to confirm your findings.

 “It’s only dangerous when spilled” – Non-spill scenarios can still lead to exposure, like fumes from mixing chemicals.

 “We haven’t had issues, so it’s safe” – Lack of incidents doesn’t equal safety. Risks need managed preventatively.

 - Review SDS for detailed exposure risks for each chemical.
- Regularly consult with staff who handle the chemicals.
- Document each identified route of exposure clearly in your risk assessment.

 ## 2. How and where is the product stored?

 Improper storage of chemicals can lead to leaks, contamination, and unsafe working conditions. Your objective is to ensure that every chemical is stored in a manner that minimises the risk of accidents or exposures.

 **Why it matters:** Proper storage practices protect against spills, degradation of the chemical, and unauthorised access, which can result in health and safety incidents. This practice is crucial for compliance with safety regulations.

 Use bullet points to detail each product’s storage information.

 Example:

 - "[Product Name] is stored in its original container with the lid tightly closed.
- Kept in a well-ventilated storage room with other non-reactive chemicals.
- Away from food preparation areas to prevent contamination."

 Ask yourself:

 - Are there chemicals currently stored in food-prep areas?
- Are all containers labelled and placed correctly?
- Is there a well-ventilated area specific for chemical storage?

 Review the 'Handling and Storage' section of the safety data sheet for each chemical.

 “Stored in whatever space is available” – Specific chemical storage areas reduce contamination risk and improve safety.

 “We don’t label everything” – Even if employees know where things are, unlabelled chemicals pose a risk, especially for new staff or emergencies.

 - Store all chemicals as per their safety data sheet guidance.
- Label all areas and containers clearly with the chemical name and hazard signs.
- Make a specific area for hazardous chemicals, away from food and drink.

 ## 3. In the event of accidental release or spillage, what equipment or material should be used to soak or clean the product?

 Spills and accidental releases are major hazards that can cause exposure, contamination, or damages. Knowing what to do immediately helps you mitigate these risks effectively.

 **Why it matters:** Correct spill response minimizes exposure and prevents situations from escalating. An appropriate response protects staff and customers and helps maintain compliance with environmental health standards.

 Detail each step along with the correct equipment used.

 Example:

 - "For a spill of [Product Name], staff should use chemical absorbent pads located next to the storage cabinet.
- Contain the spill using spill socks.
- Dispose of any contaminated materials as hazardous waste."

 Ask your staff or check your current procedures:

 - What types of spills have occurred before?
- Is there enough spill kits and materials readily available?
- Are staff trained to use spill response equipment?

 “Assume it won’t spill” – Assume every chemical has the potential to spill to ensure robust preparedness.

 “Relying on paper towels alone” – Many chemicals require specialised absorbent materials.

 - Place spill kits near high-risk areas for rapid response.
- Regularly audit your spill kits to ensure they are fully stocked.
- Train staff in spill response procedures during onboarding and refresh this training annually.

 ## 4. Describe how you have trained or informed your staff of how to use the product safely?

 Your training plan should ensure everyone who might handle, use, or come into contact with the hazardous chemical understands the risks and the precautions they need to take.

 **Why it matters:** Without proper training, staff may be unaware of the risks or fail to use the correct precautions. This significantly increases the likelihood of accidents, errors, and exposure.

 An effective answer provides details on the training approach.

 Example:

 - "All staff undergo a COSHH awareness session on their first day, which includes practical demonstrations.
- Staff have access to a COSHH folder that includes data sheets for each chemical used.
- Regular COSHH updates are conducted every 6 months to refresh staff knowledge."

 Reflect on your training sessions:

 - Is your training practical with demonstrations?
- How often are updates or refresher sessions conducted?
- Do staff have easy access to chemical safety information?

 If your training relies heavily on verbal instructions, ensure there's a written counterpart for everything your employees need to remember.

 “We explained everything during induction” – Guidelines can be forgotten after an initial training. Regular refresh important information.

 “We don’t need written materials” – If it’s not written down, it’s harder for staff to review and understand fully.

 - Ensure all training is recorded in writing and made accessible to all.
- Use scenarios and role-playing to make sessions engaging and memorable.
- Review and update training materials annually.

 ## 5. What controls are being used to manage dust if there is any?

 If your business uses chemicals in powdered form, or any process that generates dust, you need to describe what measures you have in place to control dust emissions.

 **Why it matters:** Dust from chemicals can pose inhalation hazards or even chemical reactions if not properly managed. Controlling dust movements reduces respiratory hazards and maintains air quality.

 Use bullet points to describe your dust control measures.

 Example:

 - "For dust-generating chemicals, staff use dust masks as per PPE regulations.
- Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) is installed in the mixing areas.
- Regular air quality checks are carried out to ensure levels meet regulatory standards."

 Consider your operations:

 - Is there visible dust accumulation around certain workstations?
- Are measures in place to prevent dust from becoming airborne?
- How often are air quality checks performed?

 Review any past incident reports that mentioned dust-related issues to improve your guidelines.

 “We don’t see any dust, so it’s not a problem” – Visibility isn’t a reliable metric for airborne dust hazards.

 “Dust masks are available, but not required” – Without consistent enforcement, PPE might not be used effectively by staff.

 - Ensure LEV systems are serviced and maintained regularly.
- Conduct regular training sessions about the risks of dust exposure and proper PPE usage.
- Implement a checklist system to ensure dust controls are being consistently applied.

 ## 6. Which PPE will be used if any?

 This section is where you detail the Personal Protective Equipment that your staff should use when handling any hazardous chemical.

 **Why it matters:** PPE is your last line of defence against chemical exposure. Proper use of PPE prevents injuries and health issues among employees resulting from contact with hazardous substances.

 Clearly describe the PPE required for each chemical or task.

 Example:

 - "Operators using [specific chemical] must wear goggles to prevent eye irritation.
- Nitrile gloves are compulsory when handling concentrated solutions.
- Protective overalls are used during mass mixing operations."

 Ask these questions:

 - Is there PPE available for each task that involves hazardous substances?
- Are staff trained on how to use PPE correctly?
- Is there a process for PPE replacement when worn or damaged?

 “We have PPE somewhere in the back” – It should be easy to access during any chemical-related task.

 “People know what to use” – Assumptions aren’t effective; ensuring everyone actively uses PPE is key.

 - Store PPE near areas where hazardous work is frequently performed.
- Update PPE needs annually based on wear and tear and new safety recommendations.
- Include a PPE check and restock in your regular safety audits.

 ## 7. Describe how and when your control measures will be monitored day to day and week to week.

 Once you’ve established your controls, documenting how often they’re checked and in what way ensures they stay effective over time.

 **Why it matters:** Regular monitoring and reviewing prevent controls from becoming ineffective or irrelevant. This ongoing process helps identify shortcomings early and maintain safety standards.

 Focus on frequency, responsibility, and methods.

 Example:

 - "Daily inspections are performed by shift leaders to ensure compliance with PPE use and safe storage practices.
- Monthly audits check for the integrity of ventilation systems.
- Weekly reviews involve a checklist verifying safety equipment placement and employee adherence to SOPs."

 Reflect on your current procedures:

 - How frequently are safety checks completed?
- Who’s responsible for monitoring and enforcing these safety measures?
- How is this process documented and what feedback is derived?

 “We’ll monitor safety informally” – Documentation and routine create more consistent compliance than informal checks.

 “We’ll fix issues as they arise” – Proactive checks are more valuable than reactive fixes.

 - Implement a regular monitoring schedule that includes all the safety control measures.
- Appoint specific roles responsible for daily and weekly safety audits.
- Maintain a digital or physical log book of safety checks for transparency and review.

 By taking a detailed approach and regularly reviewing safety controls, you can ensure your COSHH risk assessments are not just a box-ticking exercise, but a proactive safety measure keeping your team and customers safe. Adopt the guidance above to enhance your chemical safety processes today.
