title: How to use barbecues to improve food safety.&nbsp;
intro: >-
  If barbecues are used on site, then special steps must be taken to ensure the
  safety of food produced.

  Unlike cooking foods in an oven, the cooking temperature of barbequed food is
  difficult to control. Often foods will cook relatively quick at the surface
  but remain raw or semi cooked in other parts of the food.

  Other hazards to cooking outside include foreign body contamination as well as
  pests such as flies contaminating foods. Also, sometimes the strict hygiene
  controls carried out in a kitchen can be more difficult to maintain outside in
  the open.

  Staff must follow the safety points below in order to maintain a consistent
  level of food safety.
