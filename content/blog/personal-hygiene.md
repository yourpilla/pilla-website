Poor personal hygiene can seriously impact the safety of food we prepare and serve to our customers.

 The personal hygiene policy is in place to ensure that food handlers follow strict protocols so that you can ensure that food is safe and hygienic to eat.&nbsp;

 ## Handwashing best practices

 Diligent hand washing procedures can help to control contamination hazards â€“ microbiological, allergenic, physical and chemical and can prevent a staggering one in three diarrhoea illnesses and one in five respiratory infections. By thoroughly washing our hands with hot soapy water, you can battle harmful bacteria growth before it spreads.

 In order that hand washing can control contamination hazards, the following prerequisites must be taken into consideration:

 - Hands should be kept in good condition with short nails. Wounds and sores should be covered with blue waterproof plasters.
