Scientific research has shown that the incidence of food allergies, food intolerances and coeliac disease has been increasing significantly over a number of recent years and it is predicted that within the next twenty years the prevalence of these conditions will affect millions of people.
Restaurants, coffee shops and retail outlets who provide food and beverage have got a duty of care to protect these potential customers from harm. In December 2014 new European legislation came into play, The Food Information Regulations 2014. Looking at the bigger picture over the whole of the European union, it was decided that the 14 foods/ingredients that cause 95% of all problems in the whole of the European union would be contained within the list. 

 It has become a legal requirement that food businesses declare these specific allergens when they are used as ingredients in food that is sold. The purpose of the new legislation is to provide clear and accurate information about allergens in products so that it is easier for people affected by food allergies to make informed choices. 

 This will include all meals that are served from your location and not just pre-packed foods that are brought in by your company. All other foods must be considered including bar and other food service areas, therefore all types of drinks including beers, wines, spirits, liquors, cocktails, also anything else served from the bar including complimentary snacks, crisps, biscuits etc.

 In addition to the need to declare allergens it is the responsibility of the food business to proactively signpost and encourage customers to declare a food allergy making. Businesses should also provide suitable and sufficient systems to control allergens at all stages including through the purchasing process, delivery and storage, preparation and service, customer information, staff information, training and supervision of all food handlers.All food handlers including bar and service staff should follow the following safety points to ensure a consistent level of safety is achieved.
