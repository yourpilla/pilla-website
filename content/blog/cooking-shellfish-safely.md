intro: >-
  Shellfish will require extra care during storage, handling, preparation and
  serving and steps must be taken to ensure that do not present a risk to
  consumers.

  Staff must follow the safety points below to ensure a consistent level of food
  safety is maintained. ## Suppliers

  Shellfish must only be purchased from reputable and approved suppliers only.

  All packages of live shellfish must be delivered with the health/id tags. The
  tags and delivery notes must be retained for the purposes of due diligence and
  traceability.

  Ensure the date of delivery is recorded to allow you to trace a particular
  delivery if and when required.

  Reputable approved suppliers of shellfish should provide written assurances
  that products have been handled and stored correctly and products have been
  harvested from approved beds/areas only.
