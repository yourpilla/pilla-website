  Step 1: Define essential skills and characteristics for a successful Restaurant Host. Use a table to distinguish between must-haves (like exceptional interpersonal skills) and nice-to-haves (like knowledge of a reservation system). If you are unclear, check our article on [Restaurant Host duties and skills](https://yourpilla.com/blog/restaurant-host-job-description).

  Step 2: Plan your interview structure. Tailor it to your restaurant style:- Concise for casual dining spots- Full structure for high-volume venues
  - Extended for senior or lead host roles
  - Decide what is more crucial for you—a warm personality or technical prowess.

  Step 3: Create engaging interview questions. Use behavioural interview questions to get insights into their experience with guest interactions, multitasking, and handling pressure. Make the questions specific to your dining environment—be it fine dining, family-friendly, or luxury.

  Step 4: Develop a practical trial. Observe their ability to greet guests, organise reservations, and maintain the front-of-house poise. A 20–30-minute trial will help you understand their attitude, service potential, and organisational skills. Use a straightforward scorecard for evaluation.

  Step 5: Ensure fair and consistent evaluation. Use a scoring system that considers guest service, communication, and attention to detail.

## Step 1. Define Who You're Looking For

Before starting the interviews, clearly identify the skills and traits that a great Restaurant Host should possess.

Use this table to identify and prioritise the attributes you are seeking in a candidate:

**Must-Have****Nice-to-Have**  Exceptional Interpersonal Skills✅❌  Organisational Ability for Managing Reservations✅❌  Experience with a Reservation System❌✅  Bilingual Communication Skills❌✅   ## Step 2. Plan the Interview Structure

 With your requirements in mind, it's time to structure the interview. A well-planned interview reflects the nature of the role – dynamic and guest-focused. However, the best format varies depending on your restaurant’s style, the position’s level, and how much time you can invest. Consider these formats for Restaurant Host interviews:

 **Concise Structure (Ideal for Casual Dining or Immediate Hires)**

 - Short Interview (10–15 minutes): Targeted questions on guest interaction and multitasking.
- Brief Practical (10–15 minutes): Greeting guests and managing a few mock reservations.

 Use this format for fast-paced diners or when hiring entry-level hosts who will learn on the job.

 **Full Interview Structure (Suited for High-Volume Restaurants)**

 - Welcome and Icebreaker (5 minutes): Ease the candidate into the process and understand their communication style.
- Formal Interview (20 minutes): Explore guest service mindset, conflict resolution, and organisational skills.
- Practical Trial (25–30 minutes): Assign tasks like managing bookings, seating plans, and a simulated front-of-house service.
- Debrief and Questions (10 minutes): Allow the candidate to ask about your restaurant’s team dynamics and the role itself.

 Best for bustling establishments where the host plays a critical role in managing guest flow and experience.

 **Extended Interview Structure (For Senior or Lead Host Roles)**

 - In-Depth Interview (30–40 minutes): Includes leadership, problem-solving, and team management questions.
- Extended Practical Trial (45–60 minutes): Focus on large reservation management, conflict resolution, and handling VIP guests.
- Team Interaction (Optional): Enable candidates to interact with your staff to assess cultural fit.

 This is suitable when hiring head hosts or team leads who will set the standard for guest service and manage front-of-house staff.

 **When Creating Your Interview Structure, Consider:**

 - Time Availability: How much time can you allocate to each candidate?
- Skill Versus Service Focus: Are technical skills or personality traits more significant for the role?
- Immediate versus Long-Term Needs: Do you need a host skilled enough to handle peak times, or someone who will grow with your team?
- Restaurant Style: A casual eatery might need friendliness and quick service, while a fine dining venue may prioritise poise and attention to detail.
- Training Programme: If you offer extensive training, hiring for soft skills might be more critical than technical prowess.

 Select the structure that mirrors your restaurant's tempo and ethos. The interview process should not just fill a position, but add value to your team with someone who fits your environment and enhances guest experience.

 **Interview Structure Builder**

 Fill out this table with the components you need for a host interview structure that meets your requirements:

   **Stage****Include?****Notes (Focus Areas)**  Welcome and Icebreaker (5 mins)✅ / ❌e.g., Understanding communication style  Formal Interview Questions (15–30 mins)✅ / ❌e.g., Guest service mindset and conflict resolution  Practical Trial (20–30 mins)✅ / ❌e.g., Greeting guests and managing bookings  Team Interaction (Optional)✅ / ❌e.g., Fit with team culture  Debrief and Candidate Questions (10 mins)✅ / ❌e.g., Covering next steps clearly   Ensure your interview design reflects your dining environment and your expectations for a host. The goal is to assess what makes a great fit for your team and guest service standards.

 ## Step 3. Create Engaging Interview Questions

 Focus on *behavioural* questions, which prompt candidates to discuss real-life situations they've handled in the past. This technique gives insight into how they’ve dealt with real challenges, such as managing tough customer interactions or keeping calm under pressure. Instead of asking hypothetical questions like "How would you greet a guest?" try a real example like, "Tell me about a time you had to manage a large waiting list; how did you handle it?" This gets real responses that show you their approach to service, multitasking, and problem-solving.

 **Sample Behavioural Question Ideas for Restaurant Hosts**

 Here are some interview questions tailored to the key responsibilities of a Restaurant Host:

 - Guest Interaction: "Describe a time when you went above and beyond for a guest. What did you do?"
- Handling Conflicts: "Tell me about an instance when you had to resolve a guest complaint. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?"
- Organisational Skills: "Share an example of a busy service period you managed well. How did you keep everything organised?"
- Team Communication: "Can you describe a time you had to collaborate with the kitchen or waitstaff to improve guest service?"
- Adaptability: "Describe a moment when you had to adjust to a last-minute reservation change. How did you adapt?"

 Adapt these questions to match your restaurant’s specific requirements and ensure you uncover the qualities that make someone successful in your environment.

 **Adjust Your Scenarios Based on Your Restaurant Style:**

 - Casual Bistro: Focus on questions about maintaining a warm atmosphere and quick service, like "Tell me about an unexpected bustling evening and how you managed the guest flow."
- Luxury Fine Dining: Focus on queries regarding poise and personalisation in service, such as "Describe how you personalised service for a VIP guest and made them feel special."
- Family-Friendly Restaurant: Emphasise managing varied customer needs and remaining calm, e.g., "How do you handle noisy, busy settings to keep service smooth?"

 ## Step 4. Develop a Practical Trial

 A short practical session is invaluable, offering a glimpse into the candidate’s instinctual approach to hosting duties. Here's how you can structure it:

 **Determine Key Skills to Assess**

 Select 2–4 crucial tasks you would expect your hosts to excel at. Examples include:

 - Welcoming guests with a warm demeanour
- Efficiently managing reservations or waitlists
- Maintaining a clean and orderly reception area
- Facilitating smooth communication with the service team

 Limit the trial to essential tasks. The goal is to observe their service attitude and operational potential in a realistic yet manageable setup.

 Plan for a total of 20–30 minutes. This provides enough time to showcase their abilities without it being exhaustive.

 **Sample 30-Minute Trial Outline:**

 - 5 mins: Introduction to the reception layout
- 10 mins: Simulated guest check-in and seating
- 5 mins: Manage a reservation list or simulate handling a waitlist
- 5 mins: Simulated communication task with kitchen or service staff
- 5 mins: Quick feedback session

 **Provide Clear but Realistic Instructions**

 Explain task expectations concisely ("Greet and seat these arriving guests"). Then step back and observe. You’re not evaluating a checklist; you want to see natural hospitality skills in action.

 **Implement a Simple Scorecard**

 Maintain objectivity during evaluations. Here's a sample scorecard template:

   **Criteria****Pass****Needs Development**  Guest Greeting and Interaction✅  Reservation Management and Organisation✅  Coordination with Service Team✅  Professionalism and Poise✅   A perfect performance in all tasks isn’t expected. Focus on assessing the candidate’s hospitality instincts, attention to service flow, and basic organisational abilities.

 **Essential Trial Setup Checklist**

 Ensure everything is ready for a smooth practical session:

 - Confirm the reception or front desk is tidy and ready.
- Prepare a mock reservation list or waitlist to use.
- Inform your team about the trial for support, if needed.
- Write clear, simple task instructions to follow during the session.
- Ready a streamlined scorecard template to track your assessments.
- Set aside time for a short feedback meeting post-trial.

 A well-organised trial exemplifies your restaurant’s professional standards and can attract candidates keen to be part of a refined dining experience.

 **Sample Debrief Script**

 Conclude with a brief recap featuring encouragement and transparency:

 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1
4. $1

 Encouraging a positive final impression can bolster your restaurant’s reputation in the hospitality community, benefiting future hiring and establishing a welcoming host environment.

 ## Step 5. Ensure Consistent and Fair Evaluation

 A structured evaluation process helps eliminate bias, ensuring the best fit based on skill set and potential for the role.

 **Implement a Weighted Score System**

 Identify in advance which qualities are most critical for your host position and assign a weight. Example weighting might be:

 - Guest Interaction and Service Attitude - 40%
- Organisation and Multitasking - 30%
- Professionalism and Coordination - 30%

 Post-interview and trial, score each candidate in each category with 1–5 (1 = underwhelming, 5 = exceptional). Multiply their score by the preset weighting, and total up to identify top candidates.

 **Example Scoring Template:**

   **Criteria****Score (1–5)****Weighting****Weighted Score**Comments  Guest Interaction &amp; Service Attitude4× 0.41.6  Organisation &amp; Multitasking3× 0.30.9  Professionalism &amp; Coordination4× 0.31.2   Ensure notes accompany each score for cross-referencing later if candidates are of similar calibre.

 **The Importance of a Weighted System:**

 - Fair Assessment: Regardless of confidence levels, skills and attitude are assessed fairly.
- Focus on Essentials: Aligns with your restaurant’s true hiring priorities, such as guest service quality.
- Reduces Subjectivity: While first impressions count, a scoring system retains objectivity in candidate evaluation.

 **Post-Evaluation Reflection:**

 Once scores are assigned, use reflection to identify the candidate who fits best:

 - Do their trial outputs align with their interview claims?
- Did they exhibit genuine care for guest service and establish a flow with the team?
- Would you trust them independently handling your front-of-house during peak times, following initial training?
- Could they substantially complement your team, or merely fill a position?

 The optimal candidate strikes a balance between technical competence and service diplomacy. Carefully review scores, consider submissions, and decide after evaluating all available data. The objective is to identify the candidate whose strengths and attitudes align with your restaurant’s goals, enhancing your service ethos and team dynamic.
