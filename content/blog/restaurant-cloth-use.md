 Cloths of any description can be a major source of cross contamination both microbiological and allergenic but by using the correct cloth information laid out below, you can reduce the risk of cross-contamination.
 ## Single use wipes/cloths

 Any situation where using a cloth or wipe could potentially spread contamination, then preferably single use disposable blue centre-feed pull rolls should be used in all circumstances.In some circumstances when a cloth is for the purpose of a single task only, then in some circumstances it may be possible to use a cloth for a longer period providing there is no risk of cross contamination. E.g. J-cloths. ## Re-usable cloths

 In some circumstances it is advisable to use a harder wearing cloth that will not disintegrate when wet, is required. These cloths must be used for either a single use or a single task only, then stored safely for laundering.

 ## Colour coded cloths

 A clear policy should be clearly communicated to all staff in all areas if a colour-coding scheme is to be used. E.g.
Front of house and bar - green Kitchen - blueToilets/dirty areas – red ## Cloth laundering

 Cloths should be thoroughly washed and disinfected after each task; the wash cycle should achieve a temperature of 90°c. Designated areas for the storage of dirty cloths must be used.

 ## Oven cloths

 Separate chefs’ cloths and tea towels must be used for drying or holding hot items.
Food handlers should not carry these cloths around with them as this discourages hand washing, also cloths used for multiple purposes can potentially spread bacteria and allergens around the kitchen. ## Corrective actions

 - If dirty cloths are being used in the food area, they must be placed in the designated area or discarded&nbsp;
- Any surfaces/utensils or equipment that may have come into contact with a dirty cloth must be re-cleaned and disinfected thoroughly before being placed back into use.
- If currently using material type cloths consider changing to single use disposable paper rolls.
- If paper rolls are not available review the stock levels and the opening/closing checks to ensure constant supply.
- Food handlers found to be not following safety procedures regarding cloth usage must receive retraining and/or extra supervision.
