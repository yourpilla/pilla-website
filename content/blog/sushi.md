  Learn how to safely prepare sushi rice to prevent bacterial growth. Mixing the
  rice with vinegar helps, but you must check the pH is below 4.5. Prepared rice
  can be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours.

It is recognised that mixing sushi rice with vinegar and salt seasoning will reduce the acidity of the mix, which in turn will help prevent the growth of bacteria and the formation of their toxins e.g. Bacillus Cereus.

 This will enable it to be left out of temperature control for long periods, such as when making the sushi or sashimi. However, if we rely on this method we must be able to ensure the following; 

 - The acidity i.e. the pH of the rice and vinegar mix must be checked. This acidity will have to be low enough to inhibit bacterial growth, i.e. below pH4.5. pH meters can be purchased from specialist stores or on-line.
- The pH must be checked routinely and recorded or you must be able to show that it has been checked in some other way e.g. by using a bought in solution that has been tested by a manufacturer and following manufacturer’s instructions.

*If we are not able to standardise your vinegar/salt solution for the Sushi rice and are not able to check the pH level to ensure that it is below pH4.5, we must not allow the rice to be out of temperature control for long periods of time. If this is the case we will only prepare small amounts in advance, chill them down, store in the refrigerator and allow them to warm up to room temperature naturally just before service. 
**Using the correct solution of vinegar to reduce the pH of Sushi rice to pH4.5 or lower, should help to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus Cereus, which is commonly found in rice. However, we must still ensure that we protect the rice against physical and chemical contamination. Additionally, it is the Sushi rice that is mixed with the vinegar solution.&nbsp;Any other food e.g. fish, meat or egg, added to the product, will not&nbsp;be protected and must not be left out at room temperature. ## Preparation

 Sushi rice should be cooled to 5°C or below within 2 hours of cooking or acidified.&nbsp;Cooled rice is recommended for making sushi intended for longer term storage and consumption (e.g. 2 days). Whereas hot/warm rice mixed with cold fish should be served immediately to the customer.
