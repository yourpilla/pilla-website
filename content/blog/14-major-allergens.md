title: How to create an allergen matrix in your food business.
---


 Managing food safety is critical to any hospitality business or for that matter any business in the food industry. Managing allergens in food and drink is part of managing food safety. This includes being aware of the 14 major food allergens.
The Food Information Regulations 2014 set out the requirements in relation to managing the 14 allergens in the food and drink that you sell or provide to your customers. The regulations require that food businesses provide accurate information to their customers about the presence of any of the 14 allergens in food and drink they sell/provide.  This is important so that customers with food allergies can make an informed decision about whether to consume food and drink from your business and what food and drink is safe for them to consume. The way allergen information is provided will vary based on whether food is pre-packed, non pre-packed (loose) or pre-packed for direct sale (PPDS). For hospitality and catering businesses that serve and cook meals on site, these meals would be classified as non-packed foods. Therefore, the allergen information can be provided verbally to a customer or in writing (for example; on the menu next to each dish or by showing the customer an allergen matrix that lists all or your dishes). Many people in the U.K. suffer from severe reactions to allergens in food and drink so it's extremely important that you manage the process of storing, handling, cooking and serving food and drink correctly and safely.

 ## Use this allergen matrix

 You must keep an allergen matrix like the one below which clearly shows which allergens are in which dishes. Add your menu items to the chart below and note which allergens are included in each dish by adding an 'x'. Examples shown below:

   **Cereals****Crustaceans****Molluscs****Eggs****Fish****Peanuts****Tree Nuts****Milk****Lupin****Soya****Sesame****Celery****Mustard****Suplhites**  **Ceasar Salad**xxx  **Spaghetti Caronara**xxx  **Fish and Chips**xxxx  **Prawn Cocktail**xxx  **Margherita Pizza**xx  **Chicken Curry**xxxx  **Beef Burger**xxxx  **Mushroom Risotto**xxx   ## What are food allergens?

 Food allergens are naturally occurring proteins in food that can that cause an immediate allergic reaction in a susceptible person. Most people who suffer from food allergies know about the food and drink they need to avoid. So as a food business, you must provide clear and accurate information to your customers about the food and drink you provide.
This means that restaurants, cafes, bars, coffee shops, in fact, every type of food and drink business needs to have a good understanding of food allergens and staff should be suitably trained. There are 14 major food allergens which food businesses need to communicate their presence to customers. These are the ones that are listed in the Regulations. These 14 major food allergens have been selected as these are the ones where a large number of people suffer from food allergies. Depending on the product and the setting, the allergens would need to be communicated either on the&nbsp;label on food and drink or provided through information such as menus, allergy matrices or verbally. Food allergy sufferers can experience serious symptoms including a life threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. The food allergy can have effect from just a small amount of food and drink.Let's now explore the 14 major food allergens that food businesses must declare to customers if they are present in the food and drink you serve.&nbsp;

 ## What are the 14 major allergens?

 - Cereals that contain gluten

 The reason why this has been included in the 14 “allergens” is mainly for the purpose of protecting people who have coeliac disease, which is an auto immune disease, where the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by the presence of gluten. Wheat allergy itself is relatively rare. Although wheat itself contains the protein gluten, other common grains also contain gluten.

 The following grains, barley, rye, triticale, oats and all wheat varieties, some of which are hybrid and ancient varieties of wheat all contain gluten such as spelt, kamut, khorasan, farro, durum, bulgar, couscous and semolina. 

 Oats in the UK mainly contain gluten, because of the fact that they are heavily cross contaminated from the factories where they are milled that also mill wheat and barley.

 Certified gluten free oats can be found from accredited sources. However, oats must still be classified as an allergen due to the fact that they contain a very similar protein to gluten called avenin that has been shown to affect a high percentage of coeliac sufferers in the same way as gluten.

 Symptoms associated with coeliac disease include bloating, cramping, diarrhoea and in the longer-term malnutrition through malabsorption of vitamins and minerals, anaemia, muscle pain, aching joints, severe fatigue, depression and cancers due to long term cell damage.

 - Crustaceans

 Crustaceans are one of the big five allergens around the world.

 Shellfish within this category include lobster, crab, langoustine, prawn, shrimp and crayfish as well as any derivatives of these for example shrimp paste.

 Crustaceans can elicit true allergic reactions, the worst being full anaphylaxis.

 Symptoms range from:

 Gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, sickness, stomach cramping, bloating and diarrhoea.

 Skin problems such as severe swelling especially around the face, lips, mouth and the mucous membranes in the mouth, severe itching, severe rashes and urticaria.

 Problems with the pulmonary system, severe constriction of the trachea, bronchii and bronchioles, severely limiting the ability to breath.

 Severe problems with the circulatory system as blood vessels dilate massively leading to a life threatening drop in blood pressure that severely affects the hearts ability to function, potentially leading to a cardiac arrest if untreated.

 Extremely sensitive individuals have been known to react to vapours from shellfish.

 Note: spoiled shellfish of all types and spoiled fish can produce histamine this can lead to a condition called scombrotoxic poisoning. Symptoms can be the same as per an allergic reaction.

 - Molluscs

 Molluscs include all bivalves such as oyster, clam, muscles, cockles but also whelks, periwinkles, snails (including all land snails), cuttlefish, squid and octopus amongst others and also any derivative substances from these creatures for example oyster sauce and squid ink used in pasta.

 Allergic reactions can be the same as per crustaceans.

 - Eggs

 All egg products and derivatives must be considered including eggs from other birds for example, goose, duck, pigeon and quail.

 All types of allergic reaction are possible.

 - Fish

 All types of fish must be considered, although reactions are more prevalent in certain species such as cod, hake, haddock, mackerel, whiting, salmon, trout, herrings, bass, swordfish, halibut and tuna.

 Also consider all derivatives and oils of fish as potential allergens, not forgetting that allergens can be hidden within common products such as Worcester sauce i.e. Anchovies.

 All types of allergic reactions are possible, some people even react to the smell of fish.

 - Peanuts

 Some people mistakenly think that all types of nuts are the same, actually peanuts are unrelated to common tree nuts such as hazelnuts, they are actually legumes.

 Caution must be taken as peanuts have many other names including groundnuts, the oils derived from them sometimes being referred to as groundnut or arachis oil. Peanuts are also commonly ground into a flour, so be aware of peanut and groundnut flour.

 Peanuts are classified as one of the big five allergens around the world. Sensitivity can be extreme, even microscopic particles and odour from peanuts have caused severe anaphylactic reactions.

 Cross-reactivity is another potential problem with peanuts, as sufferers have occasionally reacted badly to other legumes that contain similar proteins for example soya, green and kidney beans, lupin and pea proteins used extensively in manufactured products.

 - Milk

 Milk can potentially produce two different types of reactions depending on if the sufferer is allergic or intolerant.

 Sufferers who are lactose intolerant can suffer sickness, diarrhoea, bloating and cramping due to their inability to digest lactose or milk sugar properly as they lack the enzyme required i.e. Lactase.

 Some people have a true allergy to the proteins found in milk and so can suffer varying degrees of allergic reaction including anaphylaxis, this is particularly prevalent in infants and small children in regard to cow's milk (CMA)

 Milk of other mammalian species is included in the legislation as many of the proteins responsible are the same or similar e.g. Goat, sheep, buffalo, yak, camel etc.

 - Lupin

 Lupin plants are commonly known by most people in the UK as common garden plants, producing bitter tasting toxins, however, sweet lupins which are not poisonous have been commonly grown in parts of Europe for many years and eaten by both humans and used as feed for livestock.

 Sweet lupin seeds are being increasingly used by manufacturers as an alternative to cereal grains to bulk out many common manufactured foods. Lupin is also increasingly found in the form of flour or seeds available as a food product in itself. 

 In some parts of Europe where the product is found more readily it is known as a common cause of allergic reactions, this is becoming more prevalent as the UK increases its usage of this product as well as many different food types appearing on supermarket shelves.

 The product has been of such concern that it has been included on the list of 14.

 The anaphylaxis campaign in the UK has advised sufferers of peanut allergies to avoid lupin as many of the proteins found in peanuts are the same ones as found in lupin.

 - Tree nuts

 One of the big five most common allergens in the world.

 Commonly referred to as nuts rather than tree nuts, they include hazelnut, brazil, almond, pistachio, pecan, walnut and macadamia and cashew nuts.

 A nut is technically a hard, inedible shell containing a seed.

 Coconut, pine nuts and chestnuts are generally not classified as a tree nut, but rather a dried seed. Although not included within the 14 allergens, some people can react to all kinds of seeds and cross reactivity is common.

 Many sufferers of peanut allergies also occasionally cross react with tree nuts.

 Businesses must also consider all derivatives of tree nuts found in foods such as unrefined nut oils used as salad dressings and almonds found in marzipan and some liquors.

 - Soya

 Soya is used extensively in food manufacturing as a high protein alternative to meat, it is also commonly used as a low-cost bulking agent in many manufactured foods.

 It can be used also as a flour and oil can be derived from it also.

 Soya bean is classified as a member of the legume family of plants, therefore cross reactivity with other common allergens such as peanut and lupin are possible in sensitive individuals.

 Allergic reaction can cover the full range with skin reactions being the most common, closely followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal reactions, anaphylaxis being rare but not unknown.

 - Sesame seeds

 Sesame seed usage in the food manufacturing industry is extensive, as a result the prevalence of allergic reactions is becoming more common over time.

 Sesame seeds and all of its derivatives including oil must be considered.

 People with nut allergies may cross react with sesame seeds in some circumstances.

 Be aware of products where seeds are sprinkled on the surface, such as breads, biscuits, breadsticks and cakes.

 Sufferers can experience the full range of allergic reactions.

 - Celery

 Celery is a common ingredient used reasonably extensively by chefs in products such as soups and sauces but also used commonly in similar foods that are manufactured.

 The root of the celery plant is commonly called celeriac, all parts of the plant are included in the legislation including celery powder, seeds, spice and celeriac powder.

 Celery allergy is most common in Switzerland, Germany and France where it is used more commonly.

 Quite often people suffer what is known as oral allergy syndrome, where most of the reactions are around the mouth, lips, tongue and surrounding tissues. Worst cases include full anaphylaxis.

 - Mustard

 Mustard allergy is relatively rare in the UK but is still one of the main 14 allergens so must still be treated as such.

 Mustard allergy is very common in France.

 Mustard and all of its derivatives including mustard powder, leaves, seeds, flowers and oils will and can cause allergic reactions at all levels, oral allergy syndrome being the most common and full anaphylaxis being the rarest reaction.

 - Sulphites and sulphur dioxide

 Sulphites and sulphur dioxide are common preservatives and antioxidants found in many manufactured foods.

 If they are present in greater volumes than 10mg per kilogram or 10 ml per litre then they must be declared on packaged foods as an allergen.

 Sulphites and sulphur dioxide can produce severe allergy like symptoms particularly asthma and particularly with individuals that already suffer from asthma or other allergies to begin with.
