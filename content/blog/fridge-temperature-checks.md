## TLDR: About Fridge Temperature Checks

 - Certain types of foods, especially high protein and high moisture foods provide perfect growth conditions for micro-organisms, both pathogenic and spoilage types. These foods can be both ready to eat and raw, bacteria will not distinguish between the two.
- The ideal refrigerator temperature is between 37°F (3°C) and 40°F (5°C). These temperatures help to slow down the growth of harmful bacteria, ensuring that your food stays fresh for longer. In the UK the legal upper limit for fridge temperatures is 8°C
- You need to check and record the temperature of every fridge unit twice per day, usually once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Pilla has a pre-built fridge temperature check inside which includes all of the inputs for staff to record compliant checks.
- If anything goes wrong, highlight the issue using the using 'Issue' button and follow the corrective actions below. Record everything that you do as a post inside the fridge temperature check so you are create a full digital paper-trail of compliance.
