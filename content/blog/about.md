  Let me start with the problem that we are trying to solve - Getting staff to consistently arrive on time for work and to consistently finish all of the activities on shift that you know must be done to have a good day.

 ## Why managing staff is harder in hospitality

 Now allow me two seconds to spell out what makes this a particularly big challenge in hospitality compared to other industries - bear with me, because I know you live this but it's worth saying:

   **High staff turnover**People come and go, so itâ€™s hard to maintain consistency in training and culture.  **Low pay and limited incentives**Motivation is a challenge when wages are low and thereâ€™s little financial upside for doing more  **Inexperienced teams**Many staff are young, new to the workforce, or using hospitality as a stepping stone, so buy-in to your business is harder  **Managers stretched thin**Youâ€™re juggling rotas, customer service, stock, and staffing gaps so thereâ€™s less time for supervision  **Verbal culture**Lots is said, not written down so expectations can be unclear, and follow-through is inconsistent.   Existing tools help to some degree but don't solve the problem fully:

   **Paper and clipboards**Things get lost, arenâ€™t followed up, and thereâ€™s no record of what was actually done. Staff tick boxes without accountability.  **Spreadsheets**Theyâ€™re clunky to use and offer limited visibility and reminders. They're static tools trying to manage dynamic teams.  **Shift Scheduling apps**They donâ€™t help with what happens once the shift starts. Staff know when they are working but not what they are working on.  **Task/To-do apps**They arenâ€™t built for hospitality, you spend hours customising them but they never fully fit your business needs.   The result? Managers end up spending more time chasing updates and updating several different systems than leading their team. Youâ€™re still not confident that the right things are happening at the right time and the team isnâ€™t improving because thereâ€™s no clear feedback loop.

 ## Our solution part 1: Why shifts and work should be together

 In hospitality, these things are connected and you need to have a handle on both.

 Thatâ€™s why Pilla brings both shifts and work into the same system and applies the same rules of engagement across both. Staff clock in on time, complete their tasks, and you can see their performance instantly. Everything counts. Everything feeds into a shared goal.

 Hereâ€™s what that unlocks:

   **Increased staff engagement**When more info for staff in one place, staff are more likely to adopt and use it more thoroughly.&nbsp;  **Fairer feedback loops**Youâ€™re not tracking performance in isolation, youâ€™re seeing how teams perform across the board.  **Simpler systems**One app, one login, one scoreboard. No more switching tools or repeating work.  **Better habits**The same daily rhythm builds across shifts and tasks: show up, get it done, do it on time.  **Clearer accountability**You can spot whoâ€™s consistent and who needs support whether itâ€™s around punctuality or task follow-through.  **Fewer dropped balls**When the same system reminds, tracks, and rewards all core activity, the right things happen more often.   ## Our solution part 2: Why gamification is the hands-off motivator you're crying out for

 Younger teams are used to feedback loops from games, social media, and everyday apps. Theyâ€™re more likely to engage with systems that feel interactive and responsive. A live leaderboard or growing streak means more to them than a printed checklist on a wall.

 Gamification gives them instant feedback, a sense of progress, and a clear role in how their team performs. It turns routine tasks into something visible and rewarding. For managers, itâ€™s a huge time-saver. You donâ€™t need to chase or remind people. The system nudges them automatically. It tracks whoâ€™s doing what, when, and how reliablyâ€”so you can focus on leading, not checking up.

 Hereâ€™s why it works:

   **It creates instant feedback**Staff know when theyâ€™ve done a good job and when theyâ€™ve dropped the ball. That alone changes behaviour.  **It builds momentum**When teams see their streaks grow, their rankings rise, and their score improve, they want to keep it going.  **It motivates without micromanagement**You donâ€™t have to chase. The system nudges people automatically.  **It makes performance visible**Staff and managers see how each team is doing, right there in the leaderboard. It creates healthy competition and pride.  **Itâ€™s inclusive**Everyone contributes to the team score, whether theyâ€™re part-time or full-time, working front of house or in the kitchen.   ## How the gamification works (and why itâ€™s fair for everyone)

 Every month, teams compete on a monthly leaderboard. We've developed our own simple scoring system which is:

   **Simple**Teams understand it instantly  **Fair**Teams of all sizes and workloads are on a level playing field  **Flexible**It works whether you're using shifts, work, or both  **Motivating**It encourages consistency over short-term bursts   Here's how the scoring works in three steps:

 1. Base Points â€“ Every shift and every work activity can earn points for the team:

 ðŸŸ© On time = 3 points
 ðŸŸ¨ Late = 1 point
 ðŸŸ¥ Missed = 0 points

 2. Hot Streak Multiplier â€“ The base points will be increased for teams on hot streaks (consecutive on time shifts and work):

 The streak multiplier is calculated as 1 + (current streak / 100), so:

- A streak of 5 gives a 1.05x boost to every shift or work activity

- A streak of 10 gives a 1.10x boost to every shift or work activity

- A streak of 50 gives a 1.5x boost to every shift or work activity

 3. Scores are averaged â€“ Lastly, each teamâ€™s total score is divided by the number of shifts and work activities completed that month. This gives a fair and simple score for all teams to see on a leaderboard:

 FOH Team: 2.45

 BOH Team: 2.23
