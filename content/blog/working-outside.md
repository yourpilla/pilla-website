  - Outside&nbsp;working risk assessments are important to ensure staff safety against varying outdoor conditions and hazards.
- You should carry out an outside working risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is protected when working outside. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built outside working risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment. 

 ## 1. What types of work are carried out outside, and by whom?

 This section is about identifying key roles and tasks involved in outdoor activities within your venue, whether permanent or occasional, daily or seasonal. You need to list these so you clearly understand who is at risk and when.

 **Why it matters:**

 Understanding who is working outside and when allows you to tailor your risk controls to protect those individuals effectively. Different tasks may involve different hazards â€” setting up outdoor seating versus managing an event, for example.

 You should record:

 - Different tasks and roles linked to outdoor work (e.g. setup crew, servers).
- Frequency and duration of these outdoor tasks.
- If these roles are full-time outdoor positions or alternate between inside and outside jobs.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 Outdoor tasks include:

 - Set-up and breakdown crews for outdoor seating (daily tasks during warm months).
- Waitstaff serving in the beer garden (regularly on weekends).
- Cleaning personnel responsible for exterior maintenance (weekly shifts).
- Event staff managing outdoor functions (occasional during summer).

 ## 2. What measures are in place to protect staff from extreme weather conditions?

 This section explains how you safeguard your team against various extreme weather conditions they may face while working outdoors including sun, wind, rain, and cold. Proper planning and resources mitigate these risks.

 **Why it matters:**

 Without adequate measures, staff can suffer from exposure-related illnesses such as heat stroke, hypothermia, or sunburn. It's crucial to have weather-related policies to adapt operations as necessary, especially under rapidly changing weather conditions.

 You should record:

 - Weather protection provided (e.g. waterproofs, umbrellas).
- Any policies to adjust work practices based on weather changes (e.g. suspend work during high winds).
- Availability of shaded or sheltered areas for breaks.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Sun protection included: company-provided hats, sunscreen, and shaded break areas.
- Waterproof jackets are issued for rainy conditions, with additional gazebo tents for equipment protection.
- Operation policies state work stops if wind exceeds 30mph or during thunderstorms.
- Staff briefing at the start of the shift includes weather updates and adjustments.

 ## 3. How do you minimise the risk of slips, trips, or falls in outdoor areas?

 This section revolves around how you maintain outdoor work areas, ensuring they are safe from slip, trip, and fall hazards. It's about ensuring that outdoor spaces are regularly checked and maintained.

 **Why it matters:**

 Outdoor surfaces can quickly become hazardous due to rain, debris, and clutter. Regular monitoring and maintenance reduce the chance of accidents. These controls are crucial in protecting staff and customers alike.

 You should record:

 - Maintenance of walking surfaces to ensure stability and grip.
- Any checks or cleaning routines in place to deal with potential hazards (e.g. wet leaves, spills).
- Equipment like non-slip mats used in specific areas.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Walkways inspected and cleaned daily by opening staff; any hazards marked or cordoned off immediately.
- Non-slip mats placed in high-risk areas, e.g., entrances or steps.
- Cabling secured with tape and checked each shift to prevent tripping.
- Drainage monitored to prevent pooling after heavy rain, with adjustments made immediately.

 ## 4. How do you ensure outdoor areas are well lit and clearly marked?

 This section addresses how lighting and visibility are managed in outdoor working environments. Ensuring sufficient light and clear visibility is key to preventing accidents and ensuring safe working conditions.

 **Why it matters:**

 Inadequate lighting can lead to accidents due to poor visibility and inability to notice trip hazards. Proper illumination is necessary for early mornings, late nights, or in adverse weather, facilitating safe and secure operations.

 You should record:

 - Type and placement of lighting used in outdoor areas.
- Frequency of lighting maintenance checks or replacements.
- Visibility aids for marking walkways and hazards.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - LED floodlights positioned at corners of the outdoor seating area and checked fortnightly.
- Solar-powered path lights line walkways, activating at dusk.
- All light bulbs inspected during weekly maintenance rounds and replaced as needed.
- Reflective tape marks step edges and low-clearance beams.

 ## 5. What control measures are in place to separate people from vehicles?

 This section explains how your business prevents unwanted vehicle-staff interactions in outdoor areas, especially where vehicles access spaces for deliveries or collections.

 **Why it matters:**

 Certain activities, like deliveries or waste removal, often require vehicle access to areas where people are also working. Proper control measures prevent collisions or injuries caused by vehicles.

 You should record:

 - Any barriers, signs, or timed access protocols used to control vehicle entry.
- Designated pathways for pedestrians away from vehicle routes.
- If vehicle access is restricted during peak staff activity times.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Barriers separate outdoor dining and service areas from delivery zones.
- Deliveries scheduled outside peak hours to avoid congestion and pedestrian traffic.
- Signposted pedestrian-only paths direct foot traffic safely away from loading docks.

 ## 6. How are manual handling tasks outside assessed and managed?

 This section pertains to how tasks involving manual handling are managed in outdoor settings. It covers not just the physical aspects but also training and equipment used to reduce strain and avoid injury.

 **Why it matters:**

 Manual handling tasks, such as moving furniture or supplies, present significant risk of musculoskeletal injuries. Proper assessment, training, and tools mitigate these risks effectively.

 You should record:

 - Any training provided for manual handling tasks.
- Equipment available to assist with heavy or awkward lifting (e.g., trolleys, dollies).
- How tasks are evaluated for potential risk before proceeding.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - All staff trained in manual handling techniques, with refresher sessions twice a year.
- Utility trolleys available for moving large furniture pieces; these are checked monthly.
- High-risk tasks require two-person teams to manage loads safely.
- Pre-task assessments carried out by supervisors to identify any potential hazards.

 ## 7. What steps are taken to protect staff from violence or antisocial behaviour?

 This section is about the measures in place to ensure staff safety from potentially hostile or antisocial behaviours they may encounter when working outside.

 **Why it matters:**

 Staff in outdoor environments, particularly street venues or events, are more exposed and vulnerable to public interactions, which may escalate into violence or antisocial behaviour.

 You should record:

 - Use of surveillance methods such as CCTV to monitor and deter inappropriate behaviour.
- Staff training on dealing with aggressive situations or individuals.
- Presence of security personnel or supervisors during high-risk periods.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - CCTV cameras cover entry points to outdoor areas, monitored from inside.
- Staff receive conflict management training, including role-plays for handling difficult customers.
- A supervisor is present during outdoor events to provide immediate support.
- Procedures established for contacting security or police if needed.

 ## 8. How do you ensure staff working outside have access to hygiene and welfare facilities?

 This section describes how you ensure outdoor-employed staff have access to necessary hygiene facilities and welfare support, such as break rooms and sanitation.

 **Why it matters:**

 Adequate welfare facilities ensure staff comfort and hygiene, which are crucial for health and morale, particularly in harsh weather conditions or longer shifts.

 You should record:

 - Provision of rest areas and hygiene facilities for outdoor staff (e.g., toilets, handwashing stations).
- How frequently these facilities are checked and cleaned.
- Any additional comforts provided for longer outdoor shifts (e.g., refreshment areas).

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Outdoor toilets available with hand sanitation, cleaned hourly.
- Covered break areas equipped with seating and heaters for cold weather.
- Reserved indoor access pass for use of main facility toilets when needed.
- Portable water stations refilled throughout the day, ensuring hydration.

 ## 9. How will these outdoor work controls be monitored over time?

 This section explains your strategy for reviewing and maintaining the effectiveness of these control measures over time. Regular monitoring ensures that risks remain low, and that control measures remain effective and up to date.

 **Why it matters:**

 Ongoing monitoring and review are essential for identifying new risks, adapting to changes, and ensuring that established controls are still working as planned.

 You should record:

 - Who is responsible for routine safety inspections and audits?
- How often these checks occur (daily, weekly, monthly).
- If staff feedback is considered in adjusting or creating controls.

 **Example of a strong answer:**

 - Safety inspections conducted weekly by the operations supervisor.
- A monthly audit of all outdoor risk controls completed by the safety officer.
- Regular staff feedback sessions to collect input and insights on safety practices.
- All findings and actions documented in a shared safety log for ongoing review.
