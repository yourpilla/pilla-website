title: How to manage hot buffets and functions safely in your business.
---
Poor handling and storage procedures when holding functions and buffets can lead to food borne illness. Temperature control and contamination controls need to be robust.

 Staff must follow the safety points below in order to maintain a consistent level of food safety.

 ## Chilled storage

 Prior to display for a function or buffet ensure that foods are kept under strict temperature control until immediately before service, that is, chilled, frozen or held hot.

 ## Temperature

 Hot foods to be placed on display for functions or buffets must have been cooked to a minimum of 75°c and then held hot above 63°c prior to placement on display.
