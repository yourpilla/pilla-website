## Step 1. Define Who You're Looking For

Hotel receptionist roles are the cornerstone of guest experience, requiring exceptional customer service skills, professional presentation, and operational competency. Different hotel types demand varied combinations of technical proficiency, interpersonal skills, and service sophistication.

**Your goal is to identify candidates with genuine hospitality passion, excellent communication skills, and professional demeanour who'll consistently deliver exceptional first impressions and ongoing guest satisfaction.**

Use this comprehensive framework to clarify your hotel receptionist requirements:

**1. Assess Your Hotel's Service Level and Guest Expectations**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We operate a luxury boutique hotel where receptionists serve as guest concierges, handling personalised requests and maintaining intimate guest relationships throughout their stay / run a busy business hotel requiring receptionists who process check-ins efficiently whilst providing professional corporate-level service / manage a family resort where receptionists coordinate activities, handle diverse guest needs, and maintain warm, approachable service style..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What level of personalised service do your guests expect?
- Do receptionists handle reservations, concierge services, or focus solely on front desk operations?
- Are you serving leisure travellers, business clients, or mixed demographics?
- What's your typical check-in volume and complexity of guest requests?
- Do receptionists need to coordinate with multiple departments or work independently?

**2. Define Your Hotel's Service Philosophy and Brand Standards**

Your receptionist requirements change based on brand positioning and guest service approach:

- "Our luxury hotel emphasises personalised, anticipatory service requiring receptionists who remember guest preferences, provide tailored recommendations, and maintain elegant professional presentation throughout all interactions."

- "We operate an efficient business hotel where receptionists must process guests quickly whilst maintaining professional courtesy, handling corporate account requirements, and supporting business traveller needs."

- "Our family resort focuses on creating memorable experiences, needing receptionists who engage warmly with guests of all ages, coordinate activity bookings, and contribute to our fun, welcoming atmosphere."

- "We specialise in boutique hospitality requiring receptionists who understand local culture, provide insider recommendations, and deliver authentic, personalised service that reflects our unique character."

**3. Establish Service and Technical Requirements for Your Operation**

Different hotel types require different capability balances:

| **Hotel Type** | **Guest Service** | **Technical Skills** | **Communication** | **Problem-Solving** |
