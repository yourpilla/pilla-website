A blast chiller is a special unit designed for the rapid cooling of food from a high temperature to a low temperature suitable for the placement of these foods into a refrigerator or freezer.

 Staff must follow the safety points above in order to achieve a consistent level of food safety.

 ## Time and temperature

 Foods should be placed into the blast chiller within 30 minutes of cooking, then chilled down in the unit within 90 minutes before placing into a refrigerator or freezer. Use the [pre-built cooled food task](https://yourpilla.com/templates/cooled-food-temperature-check) inside Pilla to record a sample of foods cooled in the blast chiller. You can read more about [cooling food procedures](https://yourpilla.com/blog/cooling-food-safely) here.

 The length of time the food takes to chill should be recorded including the start and finish time of cooling and the start and finish temperature of the food must also be recorded.

 Staff should aim for final cooling temperatures of below 3°c if possible but below 5°c is acceptable when the 90-minute maximum cooling time is reached.
