  - Training each staff member to the right level will improve food hygiene and safety. Staff need to complete specific training and meet food hygiene certificate requirements for their role in the food industry.
- Everybody needs to be trained to at least Level 1 Food Hygiene Certificate, Food Handlers need to be trained to at least Level 2 Food Hygiene Certificate, Managers such as Head Chefs need to be trained to at least Level 3 Food Hygiene Certificate and Ideally Executive Chef or Business Owner should hold a Level 4 Food Hygiene Certificate.
- You should carry out internal training for all staff such as allergy updates and personal hygiene training. These training sessions should be specific to your business processes.&nbsp;
- You should record all training in Pilla using a Training activity. This includes internal and external training. Record as many details as possible by adding posts to the activity. Adding certificates, registers and all evidence so you have it in one place. If training needs to be renewed, set the frequency of the the renewal so that the training activity will be created again in the future.

 The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system is the foundation of food safety training. HACCP is about identifying and controlling food safety hazards from production to consumption. It's about identifying high risk situations in your business and providing training to combat those risks. Each role is presented with different risks so each role needs to have it's own training profile, meaning each role should have training that is relevant to it.&nbsp;

 ## Induction Training for New Staff

 A food hygiene course is required for new staff before they start handling food. This initial training will ensure new staff understand basic food hygiene practices and are ready to work safely from day one. Induction training should cover food safety basics so new starters have a solid foundation.

 Even staff with no direct food handling, such as receptionists in food service, should get Level 1 certificates so everyone has the same level of food hygiene knowledge. This will maintain consistency across all staff and promote a robust food safety culture.

 ## Agency Workers

 Agency workers must also get food hygiene qualifications before they can sell or handle food. You must check these qualifications to ensure safety standards within your business. Written confirmation of qualifications is required before agency workers can work in kitchen areas.

 Managers must not allow agency workers to handle food until their qualifications have been checked. This will prevent any food safety lapses and protect the business and its customers.

 ## Food hygiene certificate levels for different roles

 The food hygiene certificate levels cater for different roles, from basic awareness to supervisory and management.

 These levels will ensure food handlers get the right training for their job.

 **Level 1 Requirements**

 Level 1 food hygiene certificates are for individuals with no food handling duties, such as bar staff, waiting staff and kitchen porters. This level will give them basic food hygiene knowledge so they can contribute to a safe food environment. These certificates must be renewed every 3 years to stay up to date with the latest hygiene standards.

 This training is for those not handling high risk foods but need to understand hygiene basics to support food safety. Having all staff, even those with minimal food handling duties, understand basic hygiene practices will help businesses have a strong food safety culture.

 This can be done online via e-learning platforms, convenient for businesses and staff. There are many online providers offering Level 1 courses but businesses must ensure the chosen course is accredited and developed by a qualified professional so it’s quality and relevant.

 **Level 2 Requirements**

 Level 2 food hygiene certificates are required for staff who handle food regularly, especially open and high risk foods. This level covers more advanced food hygiene standards, including legal requirements and hazard control. Anyone working with food must keep their Level 2 up to date and it must be renewed every 3 years.

 Food handlers at this level will get thorough training to handle food safely and reduce the risk of food poisoning. Keeping the Level 2 Food Hygiene certificate up to date will ensure food handlers meet the high standards of the food industry.

 This level can also be done online, same as Level 1 courses. However many businesses prefer in-person training for Level 2 as it often provides a more comprehensive learning experience. Face to face interaction with instructors will help with understanding and retention of critical food safety concepts.

 **Levels 3 and 4 Requirements**

 Levels 3 and 4 food hygiene certificates are required for supervisory and management roles responsible for developing and controlling food safety management systems. Supervisors like sous chefs and bar managers should have at least a Level 3 qualification to oversee food safety practices. Level 4 is for senior management, including HACCP team and executive head chefs, responsible for overall compliance and food safety of the business.

 Level 4 does not require renewal but CPD is expected to keep up to date with industry standards and practices. This ongoing learning will keep leadership informed and able to maintain high food safety standards.

 Due to the complexity of the course content, these levels should always be done in person. In person sessions allow for detailed explanations and one to one interaction with the tutors, ask questions and participate in discussions. This interaction is key to understanding advanced food safety management principles and implementing it in the business.

 ## In-house food safety training for food handlers to receive

 In-house food hygiene training should be carried regularly so management can make sure staff have a good understanding of your specific food safety processes.&nbsp;This bespoke training should be taken as seriously as the standard food hygiene certificates at Level 1, 2 or 3. Both management and staff must take this training seriously to maintain high hygiene standards and a safe food environment, to protect the business and its customers.

 **Example 1: Allergen awareness training**

 All staff should have training on the 14 major allergens so that they understand the fundamentals. But management should also be providing extra training every time your menu changes. This is because staff should be kept up to date with the specific allergens inside your menu items. This training doesn't need to be extensive, it can be as short as 5 minutes, but it should be recorded using the process in the section below.

 **Example 2: Personal hygiene training**

 Maintaining high personal hygiene standards is a key component to keeping food safe and preventing contamination. All staff will receive some form of personal hygiene training as part of a Food Hygiene Level 1, 2 or 3 but you should also provide your own training internally which explains exactly how your personal hygiene processes work. Again, this doesn't need to be long, but it should be specific and recorded using the process below.

 ## Documenting each training activity

 All training and certification information including documents should be recorded using the ‘Training’ activity in Pilla. When used correctly you can use this activity to communicate training to staff, record necessary information and set reminders for training renewals. Follow these guidelines for best practice:

 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1
4. $1
5. $1
6. $1

 ## Creating a food hygiene training matrix&nbsp;

 You should have a table which maps the training that each person has done like the one below, this is called a training matrix. So long as you set 'Frequency' dates on the individual training activities inside Pilla (described above) you don't need to remember when training is due for renewal because Pilla will remind you. Instead the below matrix is used to visualise quickly who has done what training. Edit the training headers on the training matrix to suit your business needs.&nbsp;
