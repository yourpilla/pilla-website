title: How to identify food safety risks in your business.
intro: >-
  A big part of your food safety management system is identifying food safety
  hazards and food safety risks in your businesses. There will be many risks in
  your business made of of different types of hazards including including
  chemical hazards, physical hazards and biological hazards which will be
  present.

  The following types of food safety risks should be well understood and senior
  food managers must consider these risks and apply appropriate controls to
  eliminate, control or mitigate these risks to ensure the safety of customers
  and clients

  1. Risks to different types of customer, these could be infants and young
  children, the elderly, pregnant ladies (and the unborn infant), people with
  low or compromised immunity and people who have food allergies and
  intolerances.

  2. Risks from different types of food, this could be because that particular
  type of food will have naturally occurring high levels of pathogenic bacteria,
  it could be that they are high protein or a moist product and will therefore
  readily accept bacterial growth if contaminated or it could be the number of
  different stages that the food has undergone which could present a greater
  risk.

  Certain types of food are more vulnerable to other types of micro-organisms
  such as viruses, microscopic parasites, worms, mould, yeasts, natural toxins
  as well as toxins released by bacteria. Some bacteria can also form spores.

  Managers must understand these risks from different foods which may need some
  research as new foods are introduced into the offering.
