# How to managed pests in your food business.

 This article has been written by Pilla Founder,&nbsp;[Liam Jones](https://yourpilla.com/profile/liam-jones), click to&nbsp;[email Liam directly](mailto:liam@yourpilla.com), he reads every email.

 Pests are a major source of contamination and need to be prevented and controlled. Pest activity and ingress can harm food and contaminate the food production environment. 
Pest activity can lead to closure of a food business, fines and poor food hygiene ratings which can harm the reputation and public perception of a business as well as lead to Integrated pest management is the process of continually managing pests through various control methods, including chemical and non-chemical practices. Integrated pest management aims to decrease pest population and reduce environmental risks.  ## Using pest control contractors

 Pest control companies are an important part of an integrated pest management system, they will advise pest management solutions based on the needs of individual locations. The pest control company will tell you when a biological control or mechanical control works best and exactly how to implement it. 
When choosing a contractor, consider the following factors: - Their ability to undertake a complete survey and provide a clear report of recommendations and actions required.
- Previous experience within the food and retail industry (and provision of references from similar size businesses.
- Adequate insurance cover.
- Reputation and accreditations.
- Staff training and qualifications.
- Large enough organisation to respond quickly and have adequate resources available at short notice.
- Clear reporting procedures and clear documentation
- Methods and materials approved under The Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986.
- Provision of up to date CLP compliant material safety data sheets (MSDS).
- General risk and COSHH assessments.
- Written safe systems of work/ safe work methods (SSOW)
- Company should be a member of the British pest control association (BPCA)

 ## Things you can do to manage pests yourself 

 As well as working with a pest control company, managers should also carry out their own regular inspections of work areas especially areas that are relatively undisturbed. Be sure to ask your pest control company for advice and recommendations on pest management actions. 

 **Pest proofing**

 Buildings must be sound and physically proofed to protect their integrity against pest ingress.
Managers must ensure that: - Brickwork is sound.
- Pipework and utilities entering/exiting buildings have been proofed.
- Drains and drain covers are sound and intact.
- Doors are tight fitting into their frames, bristle strips and kick plates should be fitted to external doors.
- Windows /doors open for ventilation have fitted fly screens.
- Eaves of buildings have been proofed to prevent rodent and bird ingress.
- Bird control measures have been taken to prevent roosting and nesting birds.
- Any other means of ingress not mentioned has been identified and control measures taken.

 **Deliveries**

 Check for pests or pest activity as part of your delivery checklist, this includes stored product insects (SPIs). Housekeepers should check deliveries of laundry as cockroaches are commonly found in industrial laundries.

 **External areas including waste areas**

 External waste storage areas can provide a ready-made source of food for rodents, insects and birds if not controlled properly. Yard areas and any nearby areas can provide potential harbourage for pest populations.
All external areas should be kept clean and tidy, all waste should be stored in commercial off the floor waste receptacles that have tight fitting lids, which are closed when not in use. Areas of vegetation should be trimmed down to prevent rodents burrowing.External areas should be checked regularly to ensure that good housekeeping practices are being adhered to stringently.

 **Ultraviolet fly units, insecticides and rodenticides**

 Electronic fly killers (EFKs) and sticky board units should be fitted in food areas to control flying insects.
They must be sited optimally for maximum efficacy by the contractor whilst being sited in such a way as to avoid physical contamination from dead / exploding insects electrocuted by the unit. They should be placed away from doors and windows to avoid attracting flies into the kitchen. Fly units must be cleaned regularly, and the fly catch trays emptied to avoid overspill.The ultraviolet tubes should be changed annually before the so called “fly season” starts in spring. The efficacy of the ultraviolet tubes will diminish over the year and even though to human eyes the tubes appear to be working, they will not attract flying insects efficiently. Ideally shatterproof tubes should be used (coated in a film that contains the glass should the tube explode).

 If insecticides are to be used in any food areas by staff or a contractor, the biggest risk is from chemical contamination of surfaces, but also physical contamination from dead insect pests. All foods must be removed from the treatment area. Treatment should only take place out of service times. All surfaces, utensils and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected afterwards.&nbsp;All rodenticides must be contained within tamper proof bait stations. A list or plan of all bait stations must be provided by the contractor, normally larger metal bait stations for rats will be sited around the perimeter of a building, whereas smaller plastic bait stations for mice will normally be sited within the building, in the kitchen and storage areas.

 Food handlers should be aware of the locations of these bait stations but must not interfere, tamper with or move them from their stated locations as per the pest control log.Dead rodents must not be removed by food handlers, call the contractor for removal immediately.

 ## Housekeeping and signs of pest problems

 Ensure all areas including kitchen and storage areas are kept free from food and other debris, especially dark and undisturbed areas.
If evidence of pest activity or ingress is found inform your contractor immediately, ensure dropping or other physical contaminants are cleaned up on a daily basis, by cleaning up daily this will give you a better picture as to the efficacy of control treatments. The following signs should be noted as evidence of pest activity / ingress.

 **Rodents**

 - Droppings, mouse droppings are small and scattered, rat droppings are larger, and spindle shaped.
- Urine, especially rat urine which has a very distinct smell
- Footprints and tail swipes in dust.
- Smear marks around runs and holes.
- Gnawing marks in food, packaging, doors and the fabric of the building.

 **Flies / flying insects**

 - Eggs, larvae (maggots), pupae (cocoons) and or live insects in food.
- Insect excreta, usually tiny smears on surfaces or food.
- Moth frass.-Excessive levels of blow flies, for example, bluebottles and greenbottles can indicate rotting flesh. E.g. Could indicate a dead rotting mouse.

 **Cockroaches**

 - Give off a distinct foul odour.
- Oothecae (egg cases) found, sometimes carried by the insect, sometimes hidden.
- Droppings, small dark smudges.
- Moulted skins (exoskeleton) found-Adult or juvenile (nymphs) cockroaches seen.

 **Ants**

 - Single or trails of ants leading to foodstuffs, especially sugary foods.
- Holes and small piles of soil close to perimeter walls and outside areas, especially flagged areas.
- Large flying queen ants on hot summer and autumn days.

 **Beetles**

 - Sometimes found infesting stored foodstuffs such as grain, corn, flour, nuts etc.
- Holes through corn, nuts, grains cause by burrowing feeding larvae.
- Beetle eggs, larvae, wing cases, droppings.

 **Birds**

 - Physical sightings of birds nesting or roosting on buildings.
- Droppings (guano) accumulating below window ledges and eaves of building.
- Feathers, nesting materials and broken egg shells.

 ## Corrective actions if things go wrong

 - Have a contingency plan for when major equipment breaks down such as using alternative equipment or changing the menu.
- Maintain a list of engineers for equipment and call them immediately when required.
- Train food handlers so that they are aware of what maintenance issues to look out for so that they are reported immediately.
- Retrain staff if necessary and give extra supervision.
