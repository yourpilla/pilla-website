  An interview with an Environmental Health Officers (EHOs): Everything You Need
  To Know
tldr: >-
  - Environmental Health Officers in the UK work directly for the local
  authority and carry out unannounced inspections on hospitality businesses.

  - These inspections are to judge the level of food safety against the Food
  Hygiene Rating Scheme. The Officer will provide every businesses with a score
  0-5 which displays the businesses level of food safety.

  - During the inspections, EHO will look at food processes, building condition
  and management processes. They are looking to see that a business has a [food
  safety management system
  ](https://yourpilla.com/blog/food-safety-management-system)and is carrying out
  daily due diligence checks.

  - EHOs can arrive at anytime and have powers which range from making
  suggestions to closing your business but they do not have the power to arrest
  anybody.&nbsp;

  Hospitality businesses have a responsibility to protect their guests from
  harm. One of the biggest risks to customers is poor food safety practices and
  this is the very thing which Environmental Health Officers work to reduce.

  You implement a food safety management system system which aims to ensure the
  safety of your guests (including preventing food poisoning) but as you will
  recognise in hospitality, things can go wrong. EHOs, like me, play in
  important role in protecting the health of the public. Working with them is
  beneficial and can help to ensure high standards of food safety in your
  business.Let's dive in and learn a bit more about EHOs, including their
  duties, powers and training. I'm an EHO and I spent 11 years working for local
  authorities, so I'll also share some of my insights with you too.
