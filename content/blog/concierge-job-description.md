## Step 1: Start with the Service Style and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 When drafting a job description for a new hire, including a section at the beginning that describes your hotel or facilty is crucial for giving potential personnel a sense of the atmosphere and standards they’ll work within. If you are also defining roles for current employees, this section can serve as a reaffirmation of the important attributes of your business.

 **Your goal is to help the candidate quickly understand:**

- What kind of establishment you manage

- The style of service you offer guests

- What working in your venue feels like

 Use this three-part structure to get started:

 **1. What type of venue are you?**

 Start with a precise label: “We’re a luxury hotel in the city centre / a boutique resort along the coast / a family-friendly establishment with extensive recreational facilities…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Explain the pace and customer interaction. For example:

- “We focus on personal touch and memorable guest experiences.”

- “We maintain a high-energy, efficient environment welcoming international travellers.”

- “Our environment is calm with a premium of attention to detail in service delivery.”

 **3. What makes your place different or appealing to work at?**

 Here are some focal points:

- “A cohesive team where each member is invaluable.”

- “Commitment to green practices and sustainable services.”

- “Employee wellness programmes and continuous professional development.”

- “Focus on regional cultural immersion and guest experience.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you're uncertain what to write, answer these questions aloud first:

- How many guests do you typically engage with each day?

- What’s a common day like in your hotel?

- How does your team balance guest service with operational tasks?

- What’s the style of guest interaction – formal, friendly, comprehensive?

- What do staff usually love about working here?

 Your goal is to paint a realistic picture, not embellish or impress.

 **Example 1: Luxury Hotel**

 We’re a high-end hotel in the heart of the city, renowned for providing tailored guest experiences and unparalleled service. Our team values meticulous attention to detail and personalised guest interaction. We leverage advanced reservation systems to streamline our services.

 **Example 2: Coastal Boutique Resort**

 We’re a relaxed, beachside boutique resort focused on serenity and unique guest experiences in synergy with nature. Our small, close-knit team prides itself on delivering intimate service. We integrate local cultural experiences into our hospitality.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Concierge

 Many job descriptions often fall short here, offering vague terms like “manage guest requests” or reusing lists that don't reflect the position’s true nature.&nbsp;

 **Your goal is to create a list relevant to your venue — not a generic one.**

 Write 6–10 bullet points describing what a concierge will be responsible for in your establishment — based on real-world daily duties.

 Consider daily phases to simplify this process:

 **1. Arrival and Orientation**

 These cover the initial duties when guests arrive or check in.

 Consider:

- Who is welcoming the guests?

- What sorts of introductions or services need doing?

 Possible inclusions:

- Greeting guests and providing a thorough introduction to the hotel’s services and amenities.

- Understanding individual guest needs and preferences.

- Informing guests of local events and attractions.

- Assisting with luggage and personalised room check-in processes.

 **2. Daily Guest Engagement**

 These are the main tasks performed throughout the guest’s stay.

 Consider:

- Level of guest engagement involved.

- Coordination with other departments for comprehensive guest care.

 Typical examples:

- Organising transportation and travel arrangements.

- Making reservations for dining, entertainment, or special events.

- Handling queries and administrative duties like booking confirmations.

- Liaising with housekeeping for specific guest requests.

 **3. Departures and Feedback**

 These tasks focus on end-of-stay or guest departure duties.

 Consider:

- Who is responsible for the final guest interactions?

- Are there specific follow-up protocols?

 Expected tasks:

- Managing guest check-outs efficiently.

- Handling guest inquiries and feedback.

- Updating guest preferences and feedback for future stays.

- Ensuring guest billing and account settlements are managed succinctly.

 **If you already have Concierges but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe their interactions and coordination with guests and other staff

- Request their insights on regular duties and any special tasks they manage

- Consult Front Office Managers for additional insights

 Useful questions to ask your Concierges:

- What are your key responsibilities during different phases of guest interaction?

- How do you navigate complex reservation requests or guest preferences?

- What steps do you take to foster guest satisfaction and loyalty?

- How do you maintain collaboration with housekeeping and management teams?

- How is guest feedback incorporated into your service delivery?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Engage a current concierge to walk through a typical shift

- Reflect on scripts or daily task lists for inspiration

- Consider what affects guest satisfaction poorly if unaddressed, and ensure it’s covered here

 **Example for a luxury city hotel**

 As a concierge, your responsibilities will include:

- Being the first point of contact and creating memorable check-in experiences

- Handling guest reservations and special service requests meticulously

- Maintaining high standards of guest satisfaction and personalizing interactions

- Informing guests of upcoming local events and assisting with relevant bookings

 **Example for a boutique resort**

 As a concierge, your responsibilities will include:

- Delivering personalised guest check-in with VIP handling

- Liaising with local service providers to facilitate unique guest experiences

- Regularly engaging with guests to enhance their stay with destination-specific advice

- Coordinating with resort services to ensure guest comfort and satisfaction

## Step 3: Define What Skills the Person Will Need to Have

 With responsibilities clear, it's important to outline the skills needed to thrive as a concierge within your specific environment. Skill definition helps candidates self-assess suitability and prevents time spent on ill-fitting applicants. Like earlier, each item should be specific to your hotel or facility.

 **Your goal is to identify necessary skills to fulfil your requirements effectively — not to compile a wish list.**

 **1. Reflect on your responsibilities list**

 Review each duty and ask: “What skill ensures success here?”

 Examples:

- If personalising guest experience, look for superior interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence

- If facilitating bespoke events, require strong multitasking abilities

- If integrating new tech, ensure candidates are tech-savvy

 **2. Separate skills into essential and desirable**

- Essential skills

 These are mandatory; without them, a candidate may struggle.

- Desirable skills

 These add value but can be developed or trained over time.

 **Consider common concierge skills**

- Strong customer service and communication aptitude

- Proficiency with hotel management software and booking systems

- Composure under pressure to manage multiple requests

- Attention to detail and precision

- Problem-solving and critical thinking capabilities

- Local knowledge of events, attractions, and geography

 Only focus on what aligns with your service style.

 **Example for a five-star hotel**

 Essential Skills

- Comprehensive experience in a hospitality environment, emphasizing guest service

- Ability to use complex reservation systems efficiently

- Exceptional communication and etiquette skills, in both person and written format

- Adept problem solver, quick-thinking and resourceful

 **Desirable Skills**

- Familiarity with luxury property management systems

- Knowledge of local cultural events and high-end leisure providers

- Additional language proficiency

 **Example for a casual family resort**

 Essential Skills

- Effective time management skills and flexibility to adapt to guest needs

- Comfortable using basic booking and POS systems

- Demonstrates energetic and enthusiastic guest interaction

- Strong organisational capabilities for juggling varied tasks

 **Desirable Skills**

- Experience planning family-friendly activities or events

- Strong local area knowledge for giving informed recommendations

- Handled guest relations in a resort environment

 Additional knowledge enables candidates to perform each task at your required standard, ensuring a reputable service experience.

## Step 4: Defining How Much Experience Is Required

 It's equally vital to clarify how much real-world experience your prospective hire should have. This sets expectations for applicants, avoiding any unclear assumptions or mismatches in capability.

 But setting experience requirements too high without justification is a common oversight that can deter capable candidates. Don't exclude those eager to learn if that suffices for the role.

 **Your goal is to articulate the necessary professional background, specifying operational context instead of just duration in years.**

 **1. Decide if this is an entry-level, experienced, or senior role**

- Entry-level: Willing to train a candidate without specific hospitality experience.

- Mid-level: This role expects practical experience in a comparable setting.

- Senior: Requires demonstrated success leading guest services with strategic responsibilities.

 Honestly assess your requirements. Labelling a position "senior" while offering basic compensation leads to dissatisfaction and role imbalance.

 **2. Explain experience relevance, not just duration**

 Instead of “2 years in the industry,” clarify setting experience. Reflect on:

- Need for prior work in high-traffic hotels?

- Experience with specific software or guest service style?

- Familiarity with handling upscale clientele and concierge duties?

 Be specific—presenting at a guesthouse isn't interchangeable with assisting guests at a high-profile resort.

 **3. Clarify training opportunities or needs**

 If comfortable with training, say so. Conversely, if independence from day one is needed, communicate that clearly.

 **Example for a mid-level concierge**

 "We seek candidates with at least one year of practical concierge or guest services experience in a hotel environment. Familiarity with concierge software and comfort handling multiple guest requests gracefully is crucial. We offer extensive training on venue-specific protocols and service enhancement."

 **Example for a junior or entry-level role**

 "No previous experience needed; however, a passion for guest service and learning is essential. Comprehensive on-the-job training provided, including all necessary software and training for a satisfying guest engagement.”

 **Example for a senior concierge role**

 "Applicants must have at least two years in a major hospitality venue, comfortably managing upscale guest expectations and special requests. Proven abilities in event facilitation and guest satisfaction metrics are invaluable. This is a pivotal role with the potential for leadership development."

## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 The importance of team cohesion rests not just on skills but personality alignment. This section of the description aids in attracting employees that will enjoy and enhance the team dynamics.

 However, job ads often fall into clichés by specifying “team player” or “motivated individual,” which lack real context.

 Instead, delve into specific attributes and behaviour that thrive at your establishment.

 **Your goal is to portray the kind of demeanor, energy, and communication that complements your existing team.**

 **1. Reflect on your current team dynamics**

 Ask yourself:

- What do your standout employees have in common?

- What types of personalities previously encountered challenges?

- Is your team oriented towards structured processes or flexible creativity?

- Is your guest interaction formal and structured, or personable and interactive?

 Jot down key traits that strengthen your ideal candidate profile.

 **2. Be explicit, not generic**

 Avoid vague traits like “collaborative” — specify the behaviours that demonstrate this. For instance:

- “Proactively switches tasks to assist during heavy guest flow”

- “Communicates updates clearly within the team”

- “Welcomes repeat guests warmly and remembers details”

 **3. Align personality with operational pressure**

- If high-traffic, challenging environments: Seek calm decision-makers who manage priorities.

- If smooth, guest-focused affairs: Find empathetic, observant communicators.

 **Example for a fast-paced city venue**

 "Success in this role comes from being adaptable, resourceful, and with the confidence of multitasking in dynamic environments. Clarity in communication and team work is vital, particularly at peak times. Ideal candidates radiate an encouraging, team-focused attitude."

 **Example for a personalised service resort**

 "Our ideal candidate is someone personable and approachable who makes every interaction memorable. A harmonious team spirit, insightful with guest preferences, and willing to extend creative solutions are core requisites, along with a genuine passion for local culture and engagement."

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask colleagues: “What personality traits do you thrive working alongside?”

- Reflect on past hires who struggled—what were the challenges?

- Communicate reality. If your pace is demanding, ask for someone adept at maintaining orderliness, not someone who purely “enjoys a hustle.”

## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 While seemingly overlooked, detailing this section is vital. Candidates deserve transparency about earnings and additional gains to actively consider your job opportunity. Disclosing perks fortifies trust and stabilises expectations.

 If premium financial offerings aren’t feasible, showcasing benefits and appealing working conditions demonstrates professionalism and attracts committed talent.

 **Explicitly state:**

- The salary or hourly remuneration

- Additional incentives and benefits

- Special aspects of employment within your location

 **1. Clearly mention compensation — hourly or salaried**

 Provide explicit figures or ranges. Unsure about setting pay? Consider:

- Local job advertisements for comparable venues (use Jobsite, Caterer, Indeed)

- Role expectations — Does it demand a novice or a skilled professional?

- If payment scales with experience, offer a reasoned range

 Example:

 £22,000–£25,000 annually depending on skillset and experienceHourly rate of £11 per hour plus tips, reevaluated after probation period Avoid ambiguous terms like “generous pay.” Such equivocal phrases frustrate candidates.

 **2. Highlight employee perks**

 Even modest incentives create favourable differences. Consider more than just monetary compensation:

- Discounted dining or accommodation offers

- Paid time-off and breaks

- Gratuities or service charges

- Emphasis on team bonding or staff meals

- Mental wellness resources

- Customisable work schedules or predictable rosters

- Ensured leave (particularly if above minimum statutory requirements)

 Example:

- Complimentary meals during shifts

- 28 days of paid annual leave inclusive of bank holidays

- Regular team-building outings and initiatives

- Equalized sharing of tips among staff

- Closing intervals over holiday periods

 **3. Indicate growth and training opportunities**

 If there’s a clear trajectory for advancement or structured training, state it.

 Example:

 Ongoing professional development supported by our internal training structure, with potential to grow into supervisory or managerial roles.

 **Sample section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £11–£13 per hour based on experience
Tips: Shared across team (averaging £2/hour) Benefits:

- Generous staff discounts and free meals provided during shifts

- 25 days paid leave plus statutory holidays

- Paid rest intervals included

- Continuous training opportunities and career progression

- Participatory team social programs

- No late-night shifts — closure at 10 pm

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask yourself: “Why would someone remain in this role?”

- Acknowledge real limits — better to underpromise than mislead

- If remuneration is competitive, emphasize alternative benefits (work-life symmetry, inviting culture, potential for growth, etc.)
