 ## TLDR; How to create a FOH cleaning schedule

 Step 1: Walk your FOH like a guest — and like an inspectorDo two slow walkthroughs (pre-open and mid-service) to spot hygiene risks, visual clutter, and hidden grime that your team might miss.Step 2: Group tasks by frequency and visibility
Organise cleaning into four levels — after each guest, daily, weekly, and monthly — and prioritise based on guest touchpoints and hygiene risk.Step 3: Include high-risk and high-impact areas
Make sure your schedule covers the FOH areas that damage trust when neglected — like toilets, payment devices, menus, and baby change stations.Step 4: Write every task clearly and completely
Use specific, action-based language so every team member knows what to clean, how to do it, and what “done properly” looks like.Step 5: Assign ownership and build cleaning into the shift
Attach every task to a named role, schedule it into real shift time, and make completion visible and trackable — not optional.Step 6: Monitor, review, and act when standards slip
Watch for missed tasks, retrain where needed, fix broken processes, and use feedback and follow-up to keep the schedule useful and effective.
 - Name: Adjust the name of the checklist if needed&nbsp;
- Site: Choose the correct site
- Team: Choose the team who will carry out the checks
- Start: Choose the next future time that the checks should be carried, for example tomorrow at 7am
- Finish: Choose the next future time that the checks should be finished by, for example tomorrow at 8pm
- Frequency: Choose 'Daily' and then select all the days that you want the activity to be created
- Tags: Add the tags that you created in step 1

 ## Creating a front of house cleaning schedule

 When a guest walks into your venue, they’re not just looking at the menu. They’re scanning the floors, feeling the table surface, noticing the marks on the window, and deciding whether they believe in your standards.

 A well-written FOH cleaning schedule protects your brand, boosts team consistency, and prevents the slow creep of mess and wear that damages guest confidence over time.

 This isn’t just about wiping tables and taking out bins. Done right, a cleaning schedule gives your team a&nbsp;clear routine they can follow every shift with defined responsibilities with no confusion.

 In this guide, you’ll learn how to build your own FOH cleaning schedule step by step. You’ll cover all areas - dining room, host stand, toilets, waiting areas - and build routines that are realistic, consistent and enforceable.

 ## Step 1: Walk your FOH like a guest — and like an inspector

 Goal: Build your schedule around what actually gets seen, touched, and judged — not just what you think gets cleaned.

 Before you create your front of house (FOH) cleaning schedule, you need to do two slow, focused walkthroughs:

 1. $1
2. $1

 You’re not just checking for dirt. You’re looking at wear and tear, overlooked zones, and customer touchpoints that affect first impressions and hygiene risks.

 And you're doing it through two lenses:

 - A first-time guest, forming an opinion within 10 seconds of walking in
- A health and safety inspector, scanning for missed cleaning, poor organisation, and hazards

 **Walkthrough 1: Before opening — see it through a guest’s eyes**

 Start outside and walk in like a paying customer.

 **1. Front entrance**

 - Is the mat clean and flat, or frayed and soggy?
- Are the glass doors smudged?
- Is the frame dusty or showing signs of weather damage?
- Are the handles greasy or sticky from last night’s service?

 What to note: The front door sets the tone for cleanliness — if it’s not pristine, guests will notice everything else more critically.

 **2. Host stand &amp; menus**

 - Are menus tidy, clean, and grease-free? Or sticky and curling at the corners?
- Are tablet screens or ordering kiosks wiped and smudge-free?
- Is there clutter on the counter — printouts, paper scraps, dirty pens?
- Is the host stand dusted, polished, and free from half-empty sanitiser bottles?

 What to note: This is where your brand has its first face-to-face moment. Any mess here damages trust.

 **3. Waiting area**

 - Are the chairs, booths, or benches clean and neatly arranged?
- Are there crumbs or debris on the seat or floor?
- Are plants dusty or artificial foliage discoloured?
- Are children’s menus, crayons or magazines tidy, or left in piles?

 What to note: Even guests who don’t wait still see this area. It reflects how much you care about detail.

 **4. Dining area**

 Walk from the guest’s viewpoint. Sit in a few seats at random — the view from a table tells you more than standing ever will.

 Check:

 - Are chair legs and backs wiped down?
- Are table edges sticky underneath?
- Are condiment holders clean and neatly stocked?
- Are chair seats free from crumbs or stains?
- Are under-table areas clean, or are there napkins and chips on the floor?

 What to note: Don’t just look at eye level — guests notice what’s at their feet and under their hands.

 **5. Floors**

 - Are carpets vacuumed all the way to the edges and under tables?
- Are mop lines visible on hard floors, or do they look untouched?
- Are any sticky spots left from drinks or sauces?
- Is anything jammed under furniture or booths?

 What to note: A clean floor is one of the first signs of discipline. Dirty floors say “we’re too busy to care.”

 **6. Windows &amp; glass surfaces**

 - Are windows free of streaks and fingerprints — especially at child height?
- Are mirrors spotless and dusted along the edges?
- Are window sills and ledges dust-free?

 What to note: Natural light makes grime obvious. Clean windows and mirrors tell guests you’ve thought about what they see.

 **7. Bar or service counter (if applicable)**

 - Are drip trays emptied and clean?
- Is the floor behind the bar free from straw wrappers, lemon wedges, bottle caps?
- Are coffee machines clean and dry at the base?
- Are shelves wiped and bottles dusted?

 What to note: The bar is often the most visible workspace. It reflects whether back-of-house standards apply in FOH.

 **8. Payment and till area**

 - Are card readers sticky or covered in fingerprints?
- Is the counter surface clean and uncluttered?
- Are tip jars clean and not overflowing with coins or receipts?

 What to note: This is the last guest touchpoint — a sticky card machine or dirty counter leaves a lasting negative impression.

 **Walkthrough 2: During or after a busy shift — see what actually happens**

 Do a second walkthrough during lunch service, or right after a Friday dinner rush. This shows you:

 - What gets missed when things are busy
- What wears down fastest
- Which tools (e.g. sanitiser bottles, cloths) are being used or ignored
- Whether bins overflow, towels run out, or items get left out

 Look especially at:

 - Tables that were recently turned
- Toilets after 20 covers
- The host stand after a wave of walk-ins
- The floor between the bar and kitchen
- Any shared tech (e.g. tablets, tills, screens)

 **Don’t forget the toilets**

 Customer toilets deserve their own cleaning plan, but you should still inspect them during both walkthroughs.

 Check:

 - Mirror condition
- Odour and ventilation
- Toilet seat and flush handle cleanliness
- Soap, toilet paper, and towel stock levels
- Overflowing bins or loose rubbish
- Baby change area cleanliness
- Doors, handles, and light switches

 What to note: Guests assume your kitchen is as clean as your loos. If the toilet is dirty, they won’t trust the food.

 **Log everything you notice**

 Create a working list of:

 - What needs cleaning
- How dirty it is before and after service
- Who should be responsible
- How often it needs attention
- What tools or products are needed

 ## Step 2: Group tasks by frequency and visibility

 The goal here is to turn your observations into a structured, realistic schedule that tells your team exactly what to clean, how often, and why it matters.

 Once you’ve done your walkthrough and noted what actually gets dirty — and what actually gets seen — it’s time to organise it into a system your team can follow. A good front of house cleaning schedule needs to do two things:

 1. $1
2. $1

 The easiest way to do this is to group tasks by frequency first, then refine them by visibility and risk.

 **Start by defining your cleaning frequencies**

 Front of house tasks fall naturally into four time-based categories. These make up the backbone of your schedule:

 **After Every Guest**

 These are the high-contact, high-turnover cleaning tasks that must be done between each party. If missed, they’re instantly visible to the next guest — or worse, create cross-contamination.

 Common tasks:

 - Sanitise table tops, chair backs, and arm rests
- Wipe and reset menus, condiments, and cutlery
- Clean and reposition high chairs or booster seats
- Check floor area under and around the table
- Sanitise handheld devices (e.g. ordering tablets, card machines)
- Wipe touchscreens or table buzzers
- Remove crumbs and fingerprints from tabletop surfaces

 Why it matters: Guests often assume that if the table isn’t clean, the kitchen isn’t clean. These are your frontline tasks for guest trust and hygiene.

 **Daily (Opening and Closing)**

 These tasks keep your entire FOH space clean and consistent at the start and end of each day. They cover general hygiene, presentation, and guest readiness.

 Opening examples:

 - Wipe down host stand, reset menus
- Polish door glass and handles
- Check toilets for cleanliness, supplies, and odour
- Restock napkins, condiments, and tabletop items
- Dust and spot-clean windowsills, skirting boards, and decorative items
- Vacuum or mop key walkways
- Empty bins and reline

 Closing examples:

 - Deep wipe all tables and chairs (not just turnover clean)
- Clean floor areas thoroughly, including under tables
- Clean and disinfect payment counters, tills, card machines
- Empty bins, replace liners, and clean bin lids
- Spot clean walls, door frames, and baseboards
- Check and clean waiting area furniture
- Restock or reorder consumables for the next shift
- Wipe down toilets, door handles, baby change, and refill supplies

 Why it matters: These routines help openers and closers start and end each shift with a clear baseline. Without them, cleaning becomes reactive instead of proactive.

 **Weekly**

 Weekly tasks focus on less visible surfaces that build up grime over time — but which still affect perception and cleanliness. They’re also essential for preventing long-term wear and hidden hygiene risks.

 Examples:

 - Deep vacuum carpets, including corners and under furniture
- Scrub hard floors, especially grout lines and sticky zones
- Dust light fittings, lampshades, air vents, and signage
- Clean skirting boards, chair legs, and bar stools
- Wipe and polish woodwork and furniture (tables, booths)
- Deep clean leather seats and fabric upholstery
- Clean behind host stands and under bar counters
- Disinfect railings, banisters, and other high-touch verticals
- Clean toilet partitions, stall doors, and baseboards
- Rotate and clean decorative items (plants, vases, picture frames)

 Why it matters: These are the slow-creep items. Guests don’t see them get dirty, but they absolutely notice when they’ve been neglected for weeks.

 **Monthly**

 These are your deep-clean and maintenance tasks — the ones that protect your venue’s appearance and infrastructure long-term. Assign these to quiet service periods or pre-open windows with experienced staff.

 Examples:

 - Deep clean and shampoo carpets
- Clean all windows, inside and out
- Clean air vents and replace filters if needed
- Polish and de-scale metal fixtures (railings, handles)
- Deep clean and test guest-facing technology (screens, kiosks)
- Clean behind and under all movable furniture
- Dust high surfaces (tops of doors, picture frames, shelving)
- Touch up scuffed or chipped paintwork in high-traffic areas
- Deep clean toilet areas: behind toilets, around sink brackets, floor corners
- Replace or clean air fresheners, door mats, and signage

 Why it matters: Monthly cleaning protects the brand as much as it protects hygiene. It keeps your venue looking “professionally run” even in the details.

 **Then refine by guest visibility and hygiene risk**

 Once you’ve sorted tasks by time, add a second layer of prioritisation: guest impact.

 Ask yourself:

 - Will a guest see this the moment they walk in?
- Will a guest touch this during their visit?
- Will this affect a guest’s perception of hygiene or quality?
- Could this spread germs or allergens if not cleaned properly?

 Use this to identify non-negotiables — tasks that must be done to protect the guest experience and legal hygiene standards.

 Example – prioritised daily tasks:

   PriorityAreaTask  HighTable surfacesWipe and sanitise after each guest  HighToilets (public)Check and clean every hour  HighMenus &amp; condimentsWipe down and polish daily  MediumBar stoolsClean seats, backs, and footrests daily  MediumWaiting area chairsWipe arms and brush seats daily  LowSkirting boardsDust daily or every two days  LowWall scuff marksSpot clean during closing shift if needed   **Format your cleaning schedule by zone for daily use**

 While the master list is structured by frequency, your daily task lists should be broken down by zone, because this is how your team actually works.

 Example zones:

 - Entrance and external door
- Host stand and reception
- Waiting area
- Main dining room
- Bar or service counter
- Toilets
- Payment and exit area

 This makes task lists easier to delegate and more likely to be completed fully — especially when paired with clear role-based assignments (we’ll cover that in Step 5).

 **Build this frequency structure into your system**

 If you’re using Pilla:

 - Use tags like FOH-Daily, FOH-Weekly, and FOH-Toilets
- Set recurring tasks by day and frequency
- Group tasks into “Work Activities” by zone (e.g. Daily Dining Room Clean)
- Use checklist notes to guide method and include standards

 If using paper:

 - Print separate lists for each zone
- Use initials and timestamps
- Highlight overdue or incomplete tasks in manager reviews

 ## Step 3: Include high-risk and high-impact cleaning areas

 The goal here is to make sure your cleaning schedule targets the FOH areas most likely to cause complaints, spread bacteria, or damage your brand - especially the ones that often get missed.

 Not all cleaning tasks carry equal risk. Some jobs protect your reputation. Others protect your customers. The very best cleaning schedules do both - because a dirty high chair is just as damaging as a sticky card machine or a smelly toilet.

 This step is about building your schedule around the right priorities — the high-risk and high-impact areas that make or break trust.

 **What counts as a high-risk or high-impact FOH area?**

 We’re talking about areas that are:

 - Frequently touched by guests or staff
- Visibly dirty if neglected
- Linked to food hygiene or public health risk
- Part of the guest’s first or final impression
- Shared between multiple users (e.g. card machines, toilets)

 If something ticks more than one of those boxes, it should not be left to chance. These tasks must appear clearly in your schedule, with explicit instructions and a realistic cleaning frequency.

 **Break it down: What to include and how to handle it**

 **1. Tables, Chairs, and High Chairs**

 Why they matter: These are guest touchpoints. Any dirt, crumbs, or grease is immediately noticed — and hard to unsee.

 Include in your schedule:

 - After every guest: Sanitise tables and chair backs with food-safe disinfectant
- Daily: Wipe down chair legs, undersides, and booth bases
- Weekly: Pull out booths to vacuum debris and clean skirting
- Monthly: Deep clean and check for wear, splits, or damage

 Tip: Write separate checks for high chairs. They require more thorough cleaning, including straps, buckles, tray edges, and legs — all of which harbour hidden food debris.

 **2. Menus, Condiments &amp; Tabletop Accessories**

 Why they matter: These often get passed between guests without cleaning. Greasy menus and dusty salt shakers ruin a clean-table illusion.

 Include in your schedule:

 - After every guest: Spot clean or sanitise laminated menus
- Daily: Clean and polish condiments, napkin holders, and toothpick dispensers
- Weekly: Deep clean containers and replace any soiled menu inserts
- Monthly: Check condition of reusable menus and accessories; replace damaged items

 Tip: If you use digital menus or tablets, sanitise screens after each use and clean edges daily. Use alcohol-based screen-safe wipes and a microfibre cloth.

 **3. Toilets (Customer-Facing)**

 Why they matter: The toilet is often the only part of your venue that guests enter alone — with time to look around. Dirty toilets make people question your entire operation.

 Include in your schedule:

 - Hourly (or more during peak times): Spot-check for spills, mess, supplies
- Daily: Clean all surfaces, disinfect seats, flush handles, door locks, sinks
- Weekly: Scrub walls, polish mirrors, clean vents and baby change areas
- Monthly: Deep clean behind toilets and around baseboards; touch up paint

 Critical risk: Toilets are a legal hygiene issue, not just an aesthetic one. Any lapses here must have corrective procedures in place (see Step 6).

 **4. Entry Doors, Handles, and Host Areas**

 Why they matter: These are your first impression. Fingerprints, sticky handles, or cluttered host stands undermine confidence before service even begins.

 Include in your schedule:

 - Opening shift: Clean doors inside and out; polish handles and signage
- Daily: Wipe host stand, pens, tablets, and leaflets
- Weekly: Dust signage, wipe down decorative items, and clean floor around host area
- Monthly: Deep clean glass panels, inside and outside, plus window frames and ledges

 Tip: Schedule this before open and again just before dinner service. Daylight reveals every smudge.

 **5. Payment Areas &amp; Card Machines**

 Why they matter: These are high-touch, shared-use items passed between guests and staff. If not cleaned regularly, they become silent hygiene failures.

 Include in your schedule:

 - After every use (where possible): Wipe card machines with disinfectant wipe
- Daily: Clean payment counter, including pens, trays, and touchscreen kiosks
- Weekly: Check charging docks, cable cleanliness, and device damage
- Monthly: Inspect card machines for wear, stickiness, or calibration errors

 Tip: Build this into your handover routine — assign the midday and closing shift to check sanitiser is available and devices are clean.

 **6. Floors &amp; Carpets**

 Why they matter: Dirty floors give guests a subconscious sense of disorder. In food service, they also pose slipping hazards and attract pests.

 Include in your schedule:

 - Daily: Sweep and mop hard floors; vacuum carpets
- Between shifts: Spot-clean obvious spills, especially near tables and host area
- Weekly: Scrub floor tiles and deep vacuum all carpets including edges
- Monthly: Shampoo carpets and degrease floors around bar/service areas

 Tip: Be specific about who does this and when. For example: “Closing FOH team to deep mop dining room floor, starting from far corner toward exit.”

 **7. Toilet Air Quality and Odour Control**

 Why it matters: Even a spotless toilet can feel unpleasant if it smells bad or feels poorly ventilated. Odour is one of the most emotionally reactive guest experiences — and one they’ll remember.

 Include in your schedule:

 - Daily: Empty bins, replace air fresheners, check ventilation fans
- Weekly: Clean fan covers and dust vents
- Monthly: Replace vent filters or clean exhaust ducts if accessible

 Tip: Use multiple controls — air fresheners, openable windows, clean bins, and dry floors — to keep odour under control. Avoid overpowering chemical scents.

 **8. Shared Tech (Table Tablets, Buzzers, Screens)**

 Why they matter: Guests touch these often and assume they’re clean. If they aren’t, they present both hygiene risks and reputational damage.

 Include in your schedule:

 - After each use: Wipe with screen-safe sanitiser
- Daily: Clean chargers, holders, and reset points
- Weekly: Inspect for damage or stickiness
- Monthly: Update and test functionality; clean ports and cases

 Pro tip: Assign this to one team member per shift — rotating responsibility to avoid missed checks.

 **9. Decor, Fixtures &amp; High-Level Dust**

 Why it matters: Guests don’t always look up — but when they do, it matters. Dusty light fittings, cobwebs in corners, or stained paintwork make your venue feel neglected.

 Include in your schedule:

 - Weekly: Wipe picture frames, signage, and decorative displays
- Monthly: Dust lights, curtain rails, top edges of booths
- Monthly: Touch up paint scuffs, re-secure loose fixings, inspect for damage

 Guest mindset tip: They won’t always notice when something is clean — but they will always notice when it isn’t.

 **Mark these as “non-negotiables” in your system**

 If you’re using Pilla:

 - Tag these checks with labels like Critical, High-Risk, or Guest-Facing
- Add extra notes or photos inside each task to show how it should look when done
- Use issue reporting to flag repeat problems or missing tools (e.g. no sanitiser at host stand)

 If using paper:

 - Highlight critical items with a star or red border
- Include initials, time completed, and notes if cleaning was delayed or couldn’t be completed
- Review critical items separately in daily manager checks

 ## Step 4: Write every task clearly and completely

 The goal here is to make every task so unambiguous that any team member - even on their first shift - knows exactly what to clean, how to do it, and when it’s finished properly.

 Too many cleaning tasks fail because they’re vague or open to interpretation. “Wipe the tables” might mean a quick cloth swipe to one person and a full sanitise and polish to another. In a busy front of house, there’s no room for guessing.

 Your cleaning schedule needs to spell it out. That means writing every task in a way that’s:

 - Specific
- Actionable
- Observable
- Repeatable

 When done right, your checklist becomes a training tool, a compliance tool, and a source of pride — not just a piece of admin.

 **Use this simple structure for each cleaning task**

 Every item on your schedule should include the following:

 1. $1
2. $1
3. $1
4. $1
5. $1

 If you’re missing any of these, the task is likely to be misunderstood or skipped.

 **Vague task examples (to avoid)**

 - “Clean host stand”
- “Wipe chairs”
- “Sanitise tables”
- “Tidy the waiting area”
- “Check toilets”
- “Clean payment area”

 These leave too many questions:
How? With what? To what standard? How often? Who's doing it? **Clear task writing examples**

 Let’s rewrite each one for full clarity and operational usefulness.

 Vague: Clean host stand
Clear: Wipe down host stand surface, menu holders, and pens using sanitiser and disposable cloth. Discard any damaged menus. Complete at start and end of shift.
 Vague: Wipe chairs
Clear: Sanitise all chair backs, seats, and arm rests using food-safe disinfectant spray. Use clean cloth and check for crumbs or spills underneath seat. Done after each guest.
 Vague: Tidy the waiting area
Clear: Remove all litter, straighten magazines and leaflets, and wipe armchairs and tables using damp cloth. Check for crumbs under cushions. Do every 2 hours during service.
 Vague: Check toilets
Clear: Inspect all toilets for cleanliness, paper, soap, and hand towels. Wipe flush handles, seats, and door locks using disinfectant wipe. Refill supplies as needed. Log time and initials every hour.
 Vague: Clean payment area
Clear: Sanitise card machine, pen, and payment counter using alcohol wipe or food-safe spray. Dry with paper towel. Done after each peak period and before closing.
 **Use strong action verbs**

 Start every task with a clear command verb that tells the team exactly what to do. Avoid soft language.

 Strong verbs:

 - Wipe
- Clean
- Sanitise
- Sweep
- Polish
- Disinfect
- Refill
- Replace
- Remove
- Inspect

 Avoid vague words like:

 - Make sure
- Tidy up
- Ensure
- Double check
- Confirm
- Sort out

 **Include standards or outcomes wherever possible**

 Whenever a task involves a judgement call — like “clean” or “wipe” — add a standard to clarify what “done properly” looks like.

 Instead of:
“Wipe window ledges.”
Use:
“Wipe and dry window ledges with damp cloth and sanitiser. Remove dust and visible marks. Leave dry and streak-free.”
 Instead of:
“Sanitise tables.”
Use:
“Spray tables with food-safe sanitiser and leave for 30 seconds contact time. Wipe dry with clean disposable cloth.”
 Instead of:
“Clean baby change area.”
Use:
“Wipe down baby change surface, buckles, and underside using disinfectant spray. Refill wipes and liners if used. Mark as complete in checklist.”
 **Use consistent phrasing across all checklists**

 For example, if one part of your checklist says:

 “Check card machine is clean”
…don’t write a different version elsewhere like:- “Wipe PDQ terminal”
- “Tidy till”
- “Sanitise payment device”

 Pick one format — e.g. “Sanitise card machine using alcohol wipe after every use” — and use it throughout. This reduces training time and improves consistency.

 **Use posts and photos to clarify tricky tasks**

 In Pilla or any digital system, add a note or image to explain anything that’s:

 - New or unfamiliar (e.g. a type of sanitiser, a new piece of tech)
- Done incorrectly in the past
- Unusual or has a specific technique (e.g. polishing brass rails)

 For paper systems, laminate visual instructions nearby or include in a cleaning binder.

 ## Step 5: Assign ownership and build cleaning into every shift

 Goal: Make your cleaning schedule a non-negotiable part of the shift routine — with clear ownership, realistic timing, and visible follow-up.

 You can write the clearest, most logical cleaning schedule in the world — but if it doesn’t fit into the rhythm of your team’s shift, it won’t be used. FOH staff are busy. They’re moving fast. Tasks without clear ownership get skipped, rushed, or done after the fact.

 This step is about building cleaning into the bones of the shift so that it gets done — properly, consistently, and without becoming a burden.

 **Build tasks into key shift milestones**

 The most effective FOH cleaning systems work by tying cleaning into routine touchpoints — so it becomes second nature. These include:

 **Pre-open checks**

 Before doors open, FOH must be clean, stocked, and ready. Build a “Pre-Service Cleaning” Work Activity (or printed checklist) that includes:

 - Entrance glass and door handles
- Host stand, menus, POS equipment
- Toilets (mirror, soap, bins, flush handles)
- Waiting area reset
- High chairs, booster seats
- Restocking consumables (napkins, condiments)

 Assign: To opening shift roles (host, first server on floor, duty manager)

 **Mid-service routines**

 Certain checks must happen during service — or risks build quickly.

 - Toilet checks every hour
- Payment area wipe-downs every 30–60 mins
- Waiting area tidy every 2 hours
- Reset condiment caddies during table turns
- Spot-mop spills on high-traffic floors

 Assign: To host, shift leader, or scheduled “floater” role (support staff)

 **Post-close deep clean**

 This should not be rushed. It sets the standard for tomorrow. Include:

 - Deep wiping all tables, chairs, and under-table areas
- Mopping floors with degreaser or sanitiser
- Emptying and cleaning bins — not just replacing liners
- Polishing windows and mirrors
- Deep clean of toilets including under seat edges and behind doors
- Bar or service counter clean-down
- Restocking supplies for AM

 Assign: Across the closing team, with final sign-off by closing manager or shift leader

 In Pilla: Set a target finish time for each activity. If the checklist is incomplete or late, it shows up in your activity log and allows for follow-up.

 **Train staff on how to complete each check — not just what to tick**

 Don’t assume people know how to clean to your standard. Onboarding must include:

 - How to clean each item — with photos, demos, or in-app notes
- Which chemicals or tools to use — including dilution, PPE, contact times
- How to spot when something needs replacing (e.g. menus, cloths, condiments)
- Where to log issues (e.g. no sanitiser available, card machine not working)

 Tip: For complex or often-missed tasks (e.g. baby change area), walk new team members through a real example during quiet hours.

 **Make the schedule visible and easy to use**

 Whether you're using a digital platform or a printed checklist, accessibility is everything.

 - Use a tablet or shared device near the host stand or in the bar if using Pilla
- For paper systems, laminate checklists by zone and place them where work happens (e.g. on cupboard doors, under tills, inside toilet doors)
- Keep cleaning logs separate from shift notes — so they don’t get lost in handover pads or rotas
- Keep supplies (cloths, sanitiser, bin liners) near each zone — if staff have to walk 30 seconds to get them, the task won’t happen under pressure

 **Follow up and enforce consistently**

 Accountability is everything. If checks are missed and no one follows up, they’ll keep being missed.

 - Managers should review checklists at shift end and take corrective action where needed
- Log and track missed or late tasks — not to punish, but to identify patterns
- Celebrate teams that consistently complete tasks well — especially during inspections
- Use issue reporting features (in Pilla or your logbook) to escalate problems — e.g. broken soap dispenser, no wipes left, bins always overflowing by 9pm

 ## Step 6: Monitor, review, and act when standards slip

 Goal: Treat your cleaning schedule as a live system — not a static list — by regularly reviewing what’s working, fixing what isn’t, and taking corrective action when problems occur.

 Even the best-designed cleaning schedule will fall apart if you don’t actively manage it. Staff change, standards drift, and tasks get rushed when service is busy. Without regular checks and clear follow-up, a “complete” checklist can still mean dusty skirting, sticky tables, and toilets guests don’t want to use.

 This step is about closing the loop — so your schedule keeps working, your team stays accountable, and your standards stay high.

 **Review your schedule regularly — especially after changes**

 Your front of house changes constantly:

 - Staff turnover means new people are interpreting your checklists
- Menus, tech, and floor layouts evolve
- Guest expectations shift (especially post-COVID hygiene)
- Service patterns change with seasons or business growth

 Set a routine to review your FOH cleaning schedule monthly. This ensures it still reflects:

 - Current equipment and layout
- Realistic cleaning times for current shift structure
- Staff feedback on what’s working or not
- Any issues raised during inspections, guest complaints, or manager checks

 Tip: Make checklist reviews part of your monthly team meeting or manager huddle. Keep it quick: What’s not getting done? What’s being missed? What should be removed or added?

 **Watch for red flags that something’s not working**

 You don’t always need a formal review to spot a problem. Keep an eye out for:

 - The same task being missed or skipped repeatedly
- “Done” tasks clearly not cleaned to standard (e.g. bins emptied but not relined)
- Complaints about cleanliness — from guests, mystery diners, or reviews
- Cleaners or FOH staff saying “we don’t have time” or “we didn’t know”
- Checklist items ticked too early (e.g. closing tasks signed off mid-service)
- No one reporting broken or missing cleaning tools

 These all indicate a process breakdown — not just poor performance.

 **Take corrective action when tasks are missed or done badly**

 If you spot something that wasn’t cleaned properly — or at all — it needs to be dealt with immediately. Otherwise, your team will learn that “tick and forget” is acceptable.

 **Suggested corrective actions:**

   IssueCorrective Action  A visible item (e.g. toilet seat, card machine, menu) is still dirty after cleaning was marked complete1. Re-clean the area immediately.  2. Ask the assigned team member to walk through the correct method.  3. Add clarification to the task if needed.  Task skipped with no note or reason1. Speak directly to the staff member responsible.  2. Review whether the timing or role assignment is realistic.  3. If appropriate, document the miss and follow your internal escalation process.  Team using wrong method or product1. Retrain the staff member immediately using a real example.  2. Update checklist with clearer instructions.  3. Review whether correct tools/chemicals are available and accessible.  Team says they don’t have time to complete cleaning1. Audit how long tasks actually take.  2. Adjust rota to allow time during service.  3. Rebalance cleaning duties across more staff if needed.  Tools or supplies unavailable (e.g. no cloths, broken dispenser)1. Refill or replace immediately.  2. Assign responsibility for stock checks.  3. Add a weekly check for critical supplies (sanitiser, blue roll, bin liners, gloves).  Recurring issues with specific zones (e.g. bar stools always dusty)1. Adjust cleaning frequency.  2. Assign task to more appropriate role.  3. Add visual reference (photo) of ‘done properly’ for training.   **Track cleaning activity and use data to improve**

 If you’re using Pilla or another digital system:

 - Review who is completing tasks (and when) using activity logs
- Spot patterns — missed tasks, late completions, or repeat issues
- Encourage teams to use “Mark as Issue” if something can’t be done — e.g. broken sanitiser dispenser or toilet blocked
- Use task completion data in weekly manager check-ins and performance reviews
- Log recurring issues (e.g. “card machines always sticky after lunch rush”) and update the schedule to include additional mid-service checks

 If using paper:

 - Collect and archive completed checklists weekly
- Note repeat gaps or overuse of “N/A” and investigate why
- Schedule surprise spot checks by managers during and after service
- Include checklist compliance in staff 1-to-1s or appraisals

 **Encourage a culture of pride — not just compliance**

 Cleaning checklists are sometimes seen as box-ticking — something you “have to do.” But when enforced well and led from the top, they become a point of pride.

 Encourage this by:

 - Recognising staff who consistently complete checks to a high standard
- Sharing inspection wins (e.g. 5-star hygiene rating) and connecting them to cleaning discipline
- Showing before/after photos of high-impact tasks (e.g. bar floor at close, baby change reset)
- Using positive reinforcement when standards are exceeded — not just punishment when they drop

 Tip: Share guest compliments about cleanliness with the team. “A clean toilet” might seem basic — but it’s rare, and it’s powerful.
