Some types of foods will require extra care to ensure food safety, in particular eggs and egg products, pulses and rice. Steps must be taken within the processes and procedures to ensure that these particular foods do not present a risk to consumers.

 Staff must follow the safety points below to ensure that a consistent level of safety is achieved.

 ## Raw egg products

 Raw eggs and lightly cooked eggs are commonly used in catering; however, they are considered too high of a risk to be served to vulnerable or risk groups such as pregnant and nursing mothers, very young children and infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.

 Foods such as bearnaise and hollandaise sauces, homemade mayonnaise, some salad dressings. Ice cream, icing, tiramisu and other desserts containing eggs, the company policy is to use pasteurised liquid eggs only.

 Pasteurised egg products must be kept refrigerated, strictly abide by the date of use once opened.
