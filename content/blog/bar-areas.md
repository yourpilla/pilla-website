 Bar areas, service areas, ice machines and post mix soft drinks

 Alcoholic drinks, soft drinks, tea, coffee, water and ice are classified as food.

 In addition to the control measures within food production areas, bar and food service areas are also critical to food safety and these areas would be privy to inspection by local authority officers carrying out food safety inspections of the premises as a whole.

 Food and beverage managers and bar managers must liaise closely with senior chefs and management to ensure that these areas are not overlooked.

 The following safety points must be considered:

 ## Personal hygiene

 Bar and serving staff must adhere to the strictest levels of personal hygiene when working with food, including drinks.

 Uniforms must be cleaned daily, consideration must be given to staff personal cleanliness when preparing to start work including hair, the wearing of make-up, perfume, after shave, personal jewellery etc.

 Staff must observe the same levels of handwashing as food handlers, they must wash their hands in handwash basins only, not sinks.

 Hot and cold running water, liquid hand-soap, disposable paper towels and waste bins must be made available, handwash basins and taps must be cleaned and sanitized before and after each shift/session.

 ## Glass storage

 Glasses and other drink containers must be stored inverted when not being used, on clean, disinfected shelving.

 ## Waste bins

 Waste bins must be emptied regularly and cleaned at the end of the day. In particular, do not allow discarded fruit and fruit juice to accumulate in bins as pests such as fruit flies are attracted to rotting fruit, good housekeeping will prevent fruit flies breeding.

 ## Water source

 Water used for ice machines must be connected to the mains and from a potable water source only.

 ## Dispensing ice

 Ice must only be handled using clean and disinfected ice shovels and tongs.

 A glass must never be used to scoop ice as they can be a potential source of glass contamination if they break or shatter.

 Shovels and tongs for ice must not be stored in the ice machine itself.

 Ice shovels and tongs should be run through the glasswasher or dishwasher several times per day to ensure that bacterial levels do not build up on the utensils.

 ## Inspection and cleaning of the ice machine

 Ice machines should be cleaned and disinfected regularly paying particular attention to biofilm build up on the dispense flaps and the overflow lever.

 Follow manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning in place (CIP) i.e. The running of cleaning and disinfecting chemicals through the pipework.

 Planned inspection and maintenance of ice machines is recommended as a proactive approach will help to avoid downtime and future problems occurring.

 ## Chilling of bottles in bar ice bath

 Ice used within an ice bath for the chilling of wine or beer must not be used for any other purpose, as this ice will be contaminated from the exterior surfaces of the bottles and present a food safety risk to customers.

 ## Suppliers

 Approved reputable suppliers with quality assurance should be used to purchase concentrated soft drink mixes. Unchecked sources must not be used.

 Suppliers must have robust hygiene and quality systems in place to ensure that products are free from microbiological, allergenic, physical and chemical contaminants.

 ## Post mix hygiene and cleaning procedures

 Connectors must be cleaned and disinfected when changing the concentrate boxes as unclean connectors can contaminate drinks passing through them with harmful bacteria.

 Connectors must be inspected regularly and maintained to avoid physical contamination.

 The dispense head must be included in any bar cleaning schedules, it must be inspected regularly and maintained to prevent the buildup of residues and biofilms.

 Follow manufacturer’s instructions for the recommended maintenance and cleaning method.

 When not in use ensure that the dispense heads are stored securely in their brackets to avoid being dropped.

 ## Corrective actions if things go wrong

 - Discard concentrate boxes that are damaged, leaking or show signs of pest damage.
- Discard all broken, chipped and cracked glasses responsibly, including any drinks or ice that may have been contaminated by broken glass.
- Maintain an up to date list of engineers for your equipment that can respond quickly to call outs.
- Retrain bar and service staff if the following safety points have been breached ensuring extra supervision if required until staff can show competency.
