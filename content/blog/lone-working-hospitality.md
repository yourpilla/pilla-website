  - Lone working risk assessments are important in identifying and mitigating risks faced by employees who work alone.&nbsp;
- A lone worker is somebody who is out of ear shot of others. You need to identify who could end up in a lone working situation (even for a short time) and carry out a risk assessment for that group of people. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built lone working risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. Who have you identified is at risk of lone working?

 Begin by identifying all employees who might be classified as lone workers. A lone worker is anyone who works out of earshot of others. You should consider each employee's role and responsibilities. For example:

 - Cleaners who open the venue early to clean before others arrive
- Chefs who prep stock alone
- A general manager who closes and locks up alone

 **Why it matters:**

 Identifying lone workers allows you to assess specific risks they encounter and ensure that measures are put in place to address these risks proactively. This foundational step sets the stage for all further safety planning.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Cleaners, chefs, and managers are identified as lone workers at various times due to their isolated tasks like cleaning, prepping stock, and locking up.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider your business's operations and layout. Ask yourself:

 - Who regularly works alone, and under what circumstances?
- Are tasks outside normal working hours or in isolated areas?
- Do any roles involve travelling or working off-site frequently?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"Only the general manager stays late, so we don’t have lone workers."** – Think beyond routine office hours; consider all roles and itinerant tasks.
- **"It's only for a short time, so they’re not really alone."** – Even short periods of lone working can carry significant risks. Always assess and plan accordingly.

 ## 2. What measures are in place to monitor wellbeing or contact the lone workers during the time when they will be working alone?

 This section asks about the communication and monitoring systems you have in place to support lone workers. Consider:

 - Availability of CCTV for monitoring
- Procedures for workers to check in/out via call or text with a supervisor
- Providing a mobile phone or ensuring access to a landline
- Inclusion in a work WhatsApp group for communication

 **Why it matters:**

 Effective communication ensures that lone workers are supported and their safety is monitored. A direct line of communication can make the difference in an emergency or if something feels off to the worker.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers text the General Manager upon starting and finishing their shift. CCTV monitors main areas and all staff have emergency contact numbers stored in their phone.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - What technology or methods are in place for real-time communication?
- Is there a clear process for what to do if a lone worker fails to check in?
- Do workers have all necessary contact details easily accessible?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We tell them to call if there’s a problem."** – This is reactive rather than proactive. Implement regular check-in/check-out procedures.
- **"We rely on workers using their own phones."** – Ensure there’s always a backup method for contacting someone, just in case their phone is unavailable.

 ## 3. How are the lone workers trained to complete the work being asked of them?

 This is about confirming lone workers are trained not only for their specific tasks but also for associated procedures such as:

 - How to access and secure the venue
- Where workplace equipment and safekeeping are
- How to manage alarms
- Switching lighting on/off

 **Why it matters:**

 Proper training prevents errors and accidents. It’s crucial for lone workers to understand all aspects of their role, both core tasks and venue-specific responsibilities.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers receive comprehensive induction training covering general duties, alarm settings, and key access points. Workflows are outlined step-by-step.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are lone workers familiar with all aspects of working alone, including locking up and security systems?
- Has your training been documented and regularly refreshed?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We show them on their first day, then assume they remember."** – Continuously reinforce training and refresh it as needed.
- **"They can call if they forget something."** – Prioritize thorough training to minimize reliance on support calls and reduce error risk.

 ## 4. How will you as an employer, remain aware of any health conditions that may affect the safety of a lone worker?

 As an employer, you should gather relevant health information, ensuring sensitivity and privacy.

 This involves:

 - Health questionnaires upon employment
- Regular check-ins to discuss any changes in health conditions
- Voluntary disclosure options for health matters that might affect safety

 **Why it matters:**

 Lone workers have specific vulnerabilities, and unaddressed health issues can pose risks. Keeping informed about potential health conditions allows you to modify tasks and safety measures appropriately.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Staff complete a health questionnaire annually and are encouraged to update management about any new health conditions or concerns.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Do you have an existing system for health questionnaires or declarations?
- Are staff aware they can disclose health information that impacts their safety at work?
- Are there regular opportunities for employees to discuss any concerns in a safe, private setting?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We only ask about health conditions when they join."** – Health conditions can change. Regular updates and open communication lines are needed.
- **"We leave it to staff to tell us."** – Proactively provide them with chances to share concerns in a confidential environment.

 ## 5. How will ensure that relevant PPE and PPE training is provided?

 Outline what Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is necessary for lone workers and confirm training is provided.

 **Why it matters:**

 Ensuring staff have appropriate PPE, and understand when and how to use it, is part of fulfilling your duty of care — especially when tasks present hazards like chemicals, sharp objects, or slips.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers receive PPE such as gloves, non-slip shoes, and eye protection where necessary. Introductory training includes when and how to use PPE effectively.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - What tasks require PPE, and are there situations when staff may skip PPE?
- Is the provided PPE suitable, tested, and regularly inspected?
- Are staff clear when and how to wear each piece of PPE?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We provide PPE but don’t enforce its use."** – Ensure staff know wearing PPE is mandatory, not optional.
- **"We gave training once."** – Training should be continual and supported by reminders, especially for new equipment or processes.

 ## 6. What measures are in place to ensure lone workers can carry out high-risk tasks safely, or that they are not carried out at all?

 High-risk activities, especially without supervision, can greatly increase chances of accidents. You should have strict policies about:

 - When high-risk activities (e.g., working at heights, hazardous chemical use) can occur
- Requiring supervision during high-risk tasks
- Clear procedures prohibiting solo high-risk tasks

 **Why it matters:**

 Lone workers undertaking high-risk tasks without support or supervision are more vulnerable to severe accidents. Policies helping to restrict or supervise these tasks are crucial.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers are not allowed to perform high-risk tasks, such as ladder use or chemical cleaning. These tasks require supervision and should be scheduled for team hours.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are lone workers required to perform high-risk tasks?
- Do you have policies mandating who performs high-risk tasks and in what conditions?
- Are lone workers aware they must refrain from these tasks without supervision?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"The team handles what needs doing, solo or not."** – High-risk tasks should never be alone duties; enforce strict bans.
- **"We trust our workers' judgement."** – Firm policies are needed since risk perception varies among individuals.

 ## 7. What measures are in place to safeguard the lone workers from violence and challenging behaviour towards them from customers, suppliers, or contractors?

 This section is to ensure protective measures are in place for lone workers to deal with potential aggression from others efficiently and safely. Consider:

 - Training in conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques
- Physical barriers, like Perspex guards, to provide extra protection
- CCTV and clear communication that surveillance is active

 **Why it matters:**

 Lone workers may be more vulnerable to confrontational or aggressive behaviour. Having plans and training in place minimises potential harm and reassures staff.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers receive training on how to handle difficult interactions and where possible, work behind Perspex screens. CCTV covers entrances to deter aggression.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are lone workers trained to manage challenging situations safely?
- When dealing with the public, is there physical protection or deterrence?
- Is aggression or harassment reporting encouraged and supported?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"The threat is minimal; no specific measures needed."** – Even minor risks require some form of protective measures or staff training.
- **"We’ve never encountered issues, so we’re fine."** – Don’t wait for an incident to take action; proactive protection is key.

 ## 8. What measures are in place to safeguard the lone workers when handling cash or high value goods?

 This is about establishing protocols that provide security and reduce theft or targeted attacks when lone workers handle cash or valuables. Consider:

 - Safe storage practices, using drop safes or locked boxes for cash
- Shifting high-value item handling to team hours, where possible
- CCTV presence in handling areas

 **Why it matters:**

 Handling money or valuables can tempt criminal acts, especially when visibility is low or unpredictable. Protect your lone workers from becoming targets.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Cash handling is moved to team shifts; workers use the safe for deposits. CCTV is installed around these key areas.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Are there times lone workers handle cash or high-value items outside company policy?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We have procedures, but they’re not always practical."** – Ensure procedures are usable and prioritize safety over convenience.

 ## 9. How will lone workers know what to do in case of emergency?

 Ensure your lone workers understand emergency protocols clearly — so they know how to react quickly and effectively if issues arise.

 **Why it matters:**

 Without clear instructions, emergencies might exacerbate. Giving confidence and clear action steps ensures lone workers manage effectively if something goes awry.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Emergency instructions are part of induction, with laminated cards posted by exits and near the time clocks.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Do lone workers know emergency procedures?
- Are instructions visible, clear, and up to date?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"They can figure it out by asking or checking later."** – In emergencies, delay puts workers at risk; ensure knowledge is immediate and engrained.

 ## 10. How will lone workers have access to first aid?

 Critical to ensuring that lone workers can self-administer first aid, if needed.

 **Why it matters:**

 First aid can mitigate minor injuries from becoming severe, especially in the absence of nearby support.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “All lone workstations have a first aid kit, checked monthly, with burns treatment, plasters, and eyewash.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Does each area have an easily accessible and suitably stocked first aid kit?
- Are lone workers trained on how to apply basic first aid?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"Kits are available but often moved or pilfered."** – Ensure accountability for the kits’ contents and regular checks.

 ## 11. If working late, after hours, what arrangements are there to ensure they have locked up and arrived home safely?

 You need protocols to safeguard lone workers leaving late from work.

 **Why it matters:**

 Ensuring team safety extends beyond your venue. Knowing they are safe en route home provides peace of mind for both workers and management.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Lone workers text when they’ve locked up and reached home. If missed, their manager follows up within half an hour.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - What is the current protocol for ensuring staff get home safely?
- Who is responsible for follow-ups if workers fail to check-in?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"They’re adults; they can handle it."** – Bringing safety to the foreground ensures responsibilities are clear and consistently enforced.

 ## 12. Are there any additional control measures which you will use to protect lone workers?

 This is where you can list any extra measures you’ve taken to tailor-fit safety to your particular operating environment.

 **Why it matters:**

 Customising solutions adds specific precautions fitting your workplace, adding layers to safety beyond standard policy.

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Have you tried working alone at your own business to spot unnoticed hazards?
- Are there unique aspects of your workplace demanding special control measures?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"We meet regulations, so additional measures aren’t needed."** – Just meeting standards may not account for all the particularities of your workspace. Measure twice, cut once.

 ## 13. Describe how and when your control measures will be monitored day to day and week to week.

 All these safety checks amount to little without a defined protocol for regular review and updates.

 **Why it matters:**

 Monitoring ensures measures remain relevant, effective, and adjusted over time as needs evolve or the workplace changes.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Example:

 - “Management reviews all lone worker protocols biannually or after any incident. They conduct regular spot checks to ensure compliance.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - Have you defined who monitors compliance and when?
- How often is training updated and relayed?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - **"Set and forget."** – Controls evolve with your business, technology advances, and team dynamics. Reinvest in them consistently.
