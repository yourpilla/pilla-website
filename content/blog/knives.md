  - Cuts and abrasions from knives are a common hazard in hospitality settings. You're legally required to assess and manage these risks to protect your staff.
- You&nbsp;should carry out a cuts and abrasions risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is protected. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions. It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built cuts and abrasions risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment.

 ## 1. What tasks are being assessed?

 This section is about identifying all activities in your kitchen that involve using knives or other sharp tools. These tasks typically include:

 - Chopping, slicing, or filleting food with kitchen knives
- Cleaning or maintaining knife blades
- Handling or storing sharp utensils
- Using mandolins or peelers

 Knowing the tasks helps you pinpoint where the highest risks are, tailor your training and controls, and ensure compliance with health and safety regulations.

 **Why it matters:** Understanding exactly what tasks involve sharp tools allows you to:

 - Target your safety measures effectively
- Highlight specific training needs for different roles
- Identify where equipment upgrades or PPE might be necessary

 **What good answers look like:**

 A good answer is task-specific and reflects daily kitchen operations:

 - “Regular use includes chopping onions and filleting fish with chef’s knives.”
- “Preparing and portioning meat using cleavers and boning knives.”
- “Dicing vegetables with mandolins, which requires close attention to technique.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Walk through a typical day in your kitchen and take note of:

 - Which tasks require sharp tools or blades
- Who performs each task — kitchen staff, bar staff, front-of-house staff
- What types of knives or utensils are involved

  **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We just use knives for everything.”
  This isn’t specific enough. Break down the tasks by activity (e.g., filleting, chopping).
  “Only chefs use knives.”
  Often front-of-house or bar staff use knives too (e.g., cutting fruit), and errors often happen with less experienced users.

 ## 2. Have staff received training in the safe use of knives and sharps?

 Describe how your staff are trained to handle knives safely. This includes how they’re taught to use, carry, clean, and store knives, as well as what they should do if they are injured while using them. Training should be regular and documented to ensure everyone maintains a high level of safety awareness.

 **Why it matters:**

 Under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, you’re required to provide adequate training and supervision to ensure employees can work safely. Effective training reduces the risk of injury significantly because:

 - Staff know how to use knives correctly and efficiently
- Common mistakes (cuts from improper technique, slips) are minimised
- Staff feel more confident and less likely to panic or use tools unsafely

 **What good answers look like:**

 Effective training includes:

 - Correct grip, cutting techniques, and posture
- How to carry knives safely and store them
- First aid procedures for cuts and abrasions
- Documentation and regular training refresher sessions

 **Example:** “All kitchen staff are trained during induction in safe knife use. Training covers proper grip, cutting technique, carrying methods, and storage. First aid procedures for cuts are also included. Training is documented and refreshed every six months.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask:

 - What specific knife skills are taught to staff?
- Are procedures written down or just explained verbally?
- Do all staff receive training, or just new hires?
- Is there a system for recording who has been trained and when?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Staff learn on the job, we don’t have formal training.”
  While experience is valuable, specific formal training ensures all staff have a consistent understanding of safety practices.
  “Only chefs get knife training.”
  Even auxiliary staff (e.g. dishwashers who help with prep) need basic knife safety training.
  “We’ve never documented training.”
  Keep records; they prove compliance and help identify who might need retraining.
  
 - While experience is valuable, specific formal training ensures all staff have a consistent understanding of safety practices.

 - Keep records; they prove compliance and help identify who might need retraining.

 ## 3. Are knives and other blades kept in safe working condition?

 Explain how you ensure knives and other blades are regularly checked, maintained, and kept in safe working condition. A dull or damaged blade poses a greater risk of accidents, as it requires more force to use, increasing the likelihood of slips and cuts.

 **Why it matters:**

 Keeping blades in good condition is part of your legal duty under PUWER 1998. A well-maintained knife results in:

 - Safer and more efficient cutting
- Fewer slips due to excessive force or resistance
- Longer-lasting kitchen equipment, reducing costs and wastage

 **What good answers look like:**

 Include:

 - Regular blade sharpening schedules
- Checks for cracks, chips, and wear
- Records of blade maintenance and replacements

 **Example:** “Knives are sharpened weekly by a dedicated staff member. Any chips or cracks are noted in our equipment log, and blades are replaced if beyond repair. Records are updated monthly to track maintenance history.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Is there a routine for checking knives before shifts?
- Who sharpens knives, and how often?
- How are damaged blades identified and handled?
- Do you keep a record of maintenance, replacements, or repairs?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We haven’t replaced knives in a long time.”
  Regularly check and replace dull or damaged knives to maintain safety.
  “Chefs handle their own knives.”
  Ensure consistent management of all kitchen knives, regardless of ownership.
  “We don’t document checks or sharpenings.”
  Keep records to prove regular maintenance and inform future purchase needs.
  
 - Regularly check and replace dull or damaged knives to maintain safety.

 - Ensure consistent management of all kitchen knives, regardless of ownership.

 - Keep records to prove regular maintenance and inform future purchase needs.

 ## 4. Do you provide equipment to reduce the risk of injury?

 List any equipment provided to enhance safety and reduce the risk of injury from knives. This might include:

 - Cut-resistant gloves or protective sleeves
- Non-slip chopping boards
- Knife guards or blade covers
- Colour-coded knives for different uses

 **Why it matters:**

 The right equipment supports safe practices and protects staff from accidents, beyond skills and training. It can also reinforce safety habits and reduce reliance on personal judgement alone.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Include details like:

 - Types of PPE or equipment provided
- When and how it’s used
- How you ensure staff use it consistently

 **Example:** “All staff are issued cut-resistant gloves to use when chopping tougher ingredients. We have non-slip boards at each station, and blade guards are used for storage. Colour-coded knives are used to prevent cross-contamination.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - What safety equipment do you currently provide?
- Is it used consistently, or only by some staff?
- Have you clearly demonstrated its use to all staff?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don’t need PPE; staff are careful.”
  The best practice is to provide options that offer additional protection, reducing reliance on individual caution.
  “We have gloves, but nobody seems to use them.”
  Ensure all safety equipment is well-integrated into routines with training.
  “We tried colour-coding, but it’s too confusing.”
  Ensure staff understand the system and why it’s important. Reinforce through training and usage checks.

 ## 5. How are knives and sharp tools stored when not in use?

 State where and how knives and sharp tools are stored safely when not in use. Proper knife storage is essential to avoid accidental cuts or damage to the blades.

 **Why it matters:**

 Proper storage is part of maintaining a safe work environment. When staff know where to find and return knives — and understand safe storage — accidents and confusion are minimised.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Describe:

 - What kind of storage solutions you use (e.g., magnetic strips, blade blocks, secure drawers)
- Where storage is located in the kitchen
- How you ensure staff return knives after use

 **Example:** “Knives are stored on magnetic strips at eye level, away from prep areas to minimise accidental contact. Secure blade guards are used for additional safety. Staff make sure to return knives immediately after cleaning.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Consider:

 - Is your storage solution easy to access yet out of the way?
- How do staff ensure knives are stored safely after each use?
- Does the storage prevent blades from getting dull or damaged?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “Knives are just put on any available surface.”
  This increases the risk of accidents. Secure storage prevents this and prolongs the lifespan of knives.
  “Staff throw knives in a drawer.”
  Loose drawer storage wears blades and increases injury risk. Use blade blocks or guards to keep them safe.
  “Storage is on the counter.”
  This can disrupt workflow and exposes staff to accidental cuts. Keep storage clear of high traffic areas.

 - This can disrupt workflow and exposes staff to accidental cuts. Keep storage clear of high traffic areas.

 ## 6. How are knives cleaned safely?

 Describe your process for cleaning knives safely. Emphasise that knives should never be left in sinks where people might reach in and cut themselves. Staff should be trained to clean and store knives immediately after use.

 **Why it matters:**

 Safe cleaning practices minimise the chances of accidental cuts. By keeping knives clean and sharp, you also maintain their effectiveness and hygiene, which is vital in a food preparation setting.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Include:

 - When and how knives should be cleaned
- What cleaning materials and methods are safest
- How to safely dry and store knives afterwards

 **Example:** “Knives are washed immediately after use with warm soapy water, ensuring that blades are never left in the sink. After drying with a clean towel, they are returned to the magnetic strip. Staff are reminded regularly during team briefings.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Is it clear who is responsible for cleaning knives after use?
- Are there any unsafe cleaning practices currently (e.g., leaving blades in soapy water)?
- What materials do staff use to clean and dry knives?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We leave knives soaking in the sink.”
  This is unsafe as it risks injury. Knives should be cleaned and put away immediately.
  “We run knives through the dishwasher.”
  High temperatures can damage sharpens and wear blades down faster. Recommend hand washing instead.
  “The last person using the knife cleans it.”
  While logical, ensure it's clear and adhered to — busy shifts can lead to rules being overlooked.

 ## 7. What procedures are in place for dealing with cuts and injuries?

 Confirm that first aid supplies are accessible and that all staff know how to report and respond to cuts. In food handling environments, it’s crucial to use blue plasters and gloves when treating even minor injuries to comply with hygiene standards.

 **Why it matters:**

 Quick and effective response to injuries reduces the impact of the injury, prevents infection, and ensures minimal disruption to operations. It’s also legally required for employers to have proper first aid procedures under the Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Detail:

 - Where first aid kits are located
- Staff training protocols for responding to cuts and other injuries
- Use of protective gear like gloves and blue plasters

 **Example:** “First aid kits are located in the kitchen and service areas, regularly checked and restocked by a designated first aider. Staff are trained annually in basic first aid procedures and must use blue plasters and gloves when treating cuts.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Are first aid kits easily accessible?
- Do staff have regular first aid training sessions?
- Is there a clear reporting system for injuries?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We’ve got a first aid kit somewhere.” 
  Kits must be clearly located, regularly checked, and staff should know how to access them quickly.
  “Only the manager knows first aid.”
  All staff should have basic first aid knowledge to ensure timely response.
  “We use any plasters on hand.”
  Blue plasters are essential in food prep areas to comply with hygiene standards and locate them easily if they fall off.
  
 - Kits must be clearly located, regularly checked, and staff should know how to access them quickly.

 - All staff should have basic first aid knowledge to ensure timely response.

 - Blue plasters are essential in food prep areas to comply with hygiene standards and locate them easily if they fall off.

 ## 8. How will you monitor these controls and reduce the risks over time?

 Note who is responsible for reviewing knife safety, checking the condition of equipment, refreshing training, and ensuring new staff are inducted correctly. Effective record-keeping and reviewing incidents can help improve safety practices.

 **Why it matters:**

 Consistent monitoring and review help catch safety issues before they escalate. They also ensure your procedures remain relevant and effective, adapting to any changes in your operation.

 **What good answers look like:**

 Include:

 - Who is responsible for ongoing safety reviews
- How often knives and controls are checked
- Systems for recording and analysing incidents to improve safety measures

 **Example:** “The Head Chef reviews knife safety monthly, checking blade conditions, PPE usage, and adherence to storage protocols. Incidents are logged, and quarterly meetings discuss trends to update training if necessary.”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 Ask yourself:

 - Is there a clear responsibility for ongoing knife and sharp tool safety?
- How often should checks occur, and how will they be documented?
- Are incidents logged, and how is data used to improve training and procedures?

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 “We don’t review safety often.” 
  Safety measures should be dynamic, reviewed regularly to ensure continual improvement.
  “Only when something goes wrong do we check.”
  Adopt a proactive approach. Routine checks can prevent incidents before they occur.
  “I don’t record anything unless serious.”
  Records give insight over time — use them to spot patterns, even for minor incidents.
