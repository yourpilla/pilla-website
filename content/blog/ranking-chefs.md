 ## TLDR;&nbsp;

 - The Chef hierarchy is a centuries old system used to delegate responsibilities in a commercial kitchen and set out a chain of command.
- It's useful for increasing efficiency because different people in the kitchen team will focus on different things - things they usually specialise in.
- It's also useful for increasing clarity on who is in charge at different times and in different areas. Kitchen's can be very busy places, so having a clear system in place means that everybody know's what to do and who to listen to when the pressure is on.

 If you're anything like I was 10 years ago, you won't know your sous chef from your commis chef. The chef hierarchy is a common feature for most professional kitchens, it's an efficient operational system that delivers high-quality dishes. Developed by legendary French chef Georges Auguste Escoffier, this structured system assigns specific roles, from the Executive Chef to the Commis Chef, each with unique responsibilities. In this article, I'll explore these roles and their importance in modern kitchens and the skills to look out for when hiring for kitchen roles. 

 ## Overview of the chef hierarchy

 The Brigade de Cuisine, (I know right, sounds so exotic) is a system developed over a century ago, and revolutionised the way kitchens operate. Inspired by military discipline, Escoffier’s system brought a structured hierarchy to the culinary world, creating clear lines of responsibility and accountability that are still used in modern kitchens today. A busy kitchen, particularly during peak service times, relies heavily on this structured approach for smooth operations and paramount efficiency.
 I had first hand experience of this in my teens when I spent a summer working as a KP at Liverpool Football Club Stadium - talk about busy! Escoffier’s system includes various chef titles, each with specific duties that contribute to the overall success of the kitchen. From the Executive Chef, who oversees the entire operation, to the Commis Chef, who assists in basic food preparation, every role is designed to support a repeatable execution of culinary tasks. This hierarchy promotes specialisation, promoting chefs to refine their skills in specific areas like sauces, roasting, or pastries, ultimately improving the quality and consistency of the dishes served.

 The hierarchical structure can vary depending on the size and style of the restaurant, but the core principles remain the same. Using clear roles and responsibilities, the Brigade de Cuisine mean that every member of the kitchen team knows their place and their duties, leading to a more efficient and effective operation. This not only improves the quality of the food but also enhances the dining experience for customers, making the chef hierarchy an essential aspect of any professional kitchen.

 ## Top-Level Chefs

 At the pinnacle of the kitchen hierarchy are the top-level Chefs, whose strategic decisions and leadership shape the culinary direction of the restaurant. These chefs, including the Executive Chef and the Head Chef, hold the highest positions in the kitchen, guiding their teams with a mix of creativity, expertise, and managerial acumen.Their roles play an important part in smooth kitchen operations and in bringing the restaurant’s vision to life. - **Executive Chef**

 The Executive Chef, often regarded as the top of the kitchen management hierarchy, plays a predominantly managerial role. Responsibilities of the Executive Chef include overseeing profitability of multiple outlets, making high-level operational and hiring decisions, menu creation and other strategic management tasks. Though they do very little actual cooking most of the time, their influence on the kitchen’s operations is massive because they establish and enforce safety, hygiene, and quality standards. 

 Collaboration with restaurant owners is another important aspect of the Executive Chefs’ role. They need to align the food and beverage offering with business goals which means making sure that the menu is a win with the customers but that it also contributes positively to the restaurant’s profitability. This position typically requires years, if not decades, of experience, as well as a deep understanding of both the culinary arts and business management.

 - **Head Chef (Chef de Cuisine)**

 The Head Chef, or Chef de Cuisine, is responsible for managing kitchen staff, setting the menu, liaising with suppliers and overseeing the budget. Unlike the Executive Chef, the Head Chef is more hands-on, directly involved in the preparation and presentation of dishes, ensuring that each meal meets the restaurant’s high standards. 

 Menu creation is often a key responsibility of the Head Chef. Creating innovative and appealing dishes, they help maintain the restaurant’s competitiveness and ability to create a loyal customer base. This role also requires meticulous management of kitchen inventory and food supplies. The title “Head Chef” is more commonly used globally, while “Chef de Cuisine” is often found in European kitchens. Regardless of the title, this role demands a blend of culinary expertise, leadership skills, and business acumen, as the Head Chef must balance creativity with the practical aspects of running a successful kitchen.
