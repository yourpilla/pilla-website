## Step 1: Start with Your Kitchen Environment
When writing an aboyeur job description, you need to paint a clear picture of your kitchen's brigade system and service style. This role is the communication hub of your kitchen, so candidates must understand the environment they'll be coordinating.

The aboyeur manages communication between all kitchen sections during service. Without a clear understanding of your specific kitchen setup, candidates can't judge whether they'll thrive in your environment.

**Your goal is to help candidates understand:**

- Your kitchen's brigade structure and hierarchy
- The pace and volume of service
- How communication flows during service
- The complexity of coordination required

Use this 3-part approach:

**1. Define Your Kitchen Type and Service Style**

Be specific about your operation: "We run a classical French brigade in a fine dining restaurant / operate a modern open kitchen with 200+ covers nightly / manage a hotel kitchen serving multiple outlets..."

Give candidates concrete details about your service model:

- Do you focus on à la carte dining with complex timing requirements?
- Are you running tasting menus that demand precise coordination?
- Do you manage multiple service outlets simultaneously?
- What's your average cover count during peak periods?

**2. Describe Your Brigade Structure**

Explain how many stations you run and the communication flow. The aboyeur's role changes dramatically based on kitchen size and structure. For example:

- "Our kitchen operates six stations with an aboyeur coordinating between the pass and each section."

- "We run a streamlined four-station setup where the aboyeur manages order flow and timing."

- "Our large brigade includes twelve chefs across multiple sections, requiring precise coordination."

- "We operate an open kitchen where the aboyeur also manages guest interaction and visibility."

Detail the specific sections your aboyeur will coordinate:

- How many different protein stations?
- Do you have separate pastry and garde manger sections?
- Is there a dedicated sauce station requiring coordination?
- Do stations work independently or require constant synchronisation?

**3. Highlight Your Service Characteristics**

Showcase what makes your service unique and challenging:

- "We maintain seamless communication during 150-cover services with complex tasting menus."

- "Our à la carte service demands split-second timing across multiple dietary requirements."

- "We coordinate simultaneous banquet and restaurant service with precise timing."

- "Our kitchen serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner with different brigade structures for each service."

- "We operate with an exhibition kitchen where presentation and communication are visible to guests."

**Tips if you're unsure**

To get started, answer these questions comprehensively:

- How many covers do you serve during peak service periods?
- How many different stations does your aboyeur coordinate daily?
- Do you run à la carte, set menus, or both service styles?
- What's the complexity level of your menu items and cooking techniques?
- How does information flow from front of house to kitchen sections?
- What makes your service challenging or unique compared to other establishments?
- Do you have any special dietary programmes or allergen protocols?
- How does your kitchen handle modifications and special requests?
- What's your typical service duration and how many sittings?
- Do staff rotate between stations or maintain fixed positions?

**Additional considerations for your environment description:**

- Kitchen technology: Do you use kitchen display systems, paper tickets, or verbal communication?
- Service timing: Are you operating continuous service or distinct lunch/dinner periods?
- Staff structure: How many chefs work under the aboyeur's coordination?
- Quality standards: What level of precision and presentation do you maintain?
- Customer interaction: Does the aboyeur interface with front of house or management?

**Example 1: High-Volume Fine Dining**

We operate a prestigious restaurant serving 180 covers nightly with an intricate seven-course tasting menu. Our aboyeur coordinates between eight specialized stations, ensuring flawless timing and communication across proteins, garnishes, and accompaniments. The role demands exceptional organisational skills and the ability to maintain calm precision during our busiest services. Our kitchen uses both digital displays and verbal communication, with the aboyeur managing complex dietary modifications and wine pairing coordination with our sommelier team.

**Example 2: Boutique Hotel Kitchen**

We run a sophisticated hotel kitchen serving our restaurant, room service, and private dining across three distinct service periods. Our aboyeur manages communication between four main stations whilst coordinating multiple service styles simultaneously. The environment is fast-paced yet supportive, with emphasis on quality and guest satisfaction. You'll coordinate breakfast buffet preparation, à la carte lunch service, and evening fine dining, each requiring different brigade coordination and timing approaches.

**Example 3: Modern Brasserie**

We're a bustling neighborhood brasserie serving 120 covers during peak periods with an open kitchen concept. Our aboyeur orchestrates five stations while maintaining visible professionalism for our guests. The role involves coordinating classic French techniques with modern presentation across our seasonal menu. You'll manage both individual à la carte orders and group bookings, requiring flexible communication styles and timing adjustments throughout service.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Aboyeur

The aboyeur role varies significantly between kitchens, so avoid generic descriptions. Focus on the specific tasks your aboyeur performs daily, from order management to quality control.

It's crucial for job descriptions to be specific here. Avoid vague phrases like "coordinate kitchen operations" and create a detailed list of actual tasks. This ensures prospective aboyeurs know what's expected and can judge their suitability clearly.

**Your goal is to outline tasks that reflect your kitchen's actual operations and service demands.**

Write 8–12 bullet points covering the aboyeur's responsibilities throughout service. Segment the role into three clear areas for maximum clarity:

**1. Pre-Service Preparation**

These tasks occur before service begins and set the foundation for smooth operations:

Consider who handles what before service:

- Who organises the pass and prepares service tools?
- What coordination happens with front of house?
- How are special requirements communicated to stations?

Common pre-service tasks include:

- Setting up the pass with proper equipment, plates, and garnish stations
- Reviewing the day's reservations, special requirements, and dietary restrictions
- Coordinating with front of house on menu changes, specials, or price adjustments
- Ensuring all stations have proper mise en place and are ready for service
- Briefing the brigade on service expectations, covers, and timing requirements
- Checking kitchen display systems or communication tools are functioning
- Organising cleaning supplies and equipment for service maintenance
- Coordinating with management on staffing levels and station assignments

**2. Service Coordination**

The core responsibilities during actual service - this is where the aboyeur's expertise truly shows:

Ask yourself what coordination your service demands:

- How complex is your order management system?
- What level of timing coordination do you require?
- How do you handle dietary restrictions and modifications?
- What quality standards must be maintained?

Essential service tasks include:

- Calling out orders clearly and managing ticket flow across all stations
- Coordinating timing between all kitchen stations for simultaneous completion
- Quality checking every dish for presentation, temperature, and accuracy before service
- Managing special dietary requirements, allergies, and guest modifications
- Communicating with front of house on order timing and any service delays
- Tracking order progress and identifying potential bottlenecks or issues
- Coordinating garnish application and final presentation touches
- Managing guest interaction for open kitchen environments
- Handling priority orders and VIP guest requirements
- Coordinating with wine service and sommelier timing

**3. Service Support and Close**

Tasks that support service flow and post-service duties:

Consider your kitchen's closing requirements:

- What documentation needs to be maintained?
- How do you handle end-of-service coordination?
- What feedback systems do you use?

End-of-service responsibilities encompass:

- Tracking order progress and identifying bottlenecks during busy periods
- Coordinating with management on service issues or guest complaints
- Assisting with final quality checks and garnishing during peak times
- Managing end-of-service coordination and staff debriefs
- Ensuring proper handover documentation for following shifts
- Coordinating final table clearance and kitchen close-down procedures
- Documenting any service issues or improvements for management review
- Supporting team morale and recognising excellent performance during service

**If you have an aboyeur but no documented duties, you can:**

- Shadow your current aboyeur: Observe their communication patterns, timing methods, and coordination techniques throughout an entire service.
- Document their dialogue: Note specific phrases they use to call orders, manage timing, and handle complications or modifications.
- Consult your head chef: Understand expectations for order flow, quality standards, communication protocols, and team leadership.
- Review service videos: If available, analyse how coordination flows during different service intensities.

Key questions to ask your current aboyeur might be:

- How do you prioritise orders during busy periods when multiple tables need coordination?
- What communication methods work best with each station and different personality types?
- How do you handle last-minute modifications or special dietary requests?
- What quality standards do you maintain at the pass and how do you enforce them?
- How do you coordinate with front of house during service without disrupting kitchen flow?
- What techniques do you use to manage stress and maintain team morale during busy periods?
- How do you handle mistakes or delays without compromising overall service quality?
- What systems do you use to track order progress and ensure nothing gets missed?

**Tips if you're unsure**

To develop comprehensive responsibility lists:

- Ask an existing staff member to outline a complete service from start to finish
- Use operation checklists you have in place as a foundation for the role description
- Concentrate on what areas break down when coordination fails to address those directly
- Consider seasonal variations or special event requirements that might affect the role
- Think about technology integration and how digital systems support or complicate coordination

**Example for a modern brasserie**

As an aboyeur, your responsibilities include:

- Managing order flow from point of sale systems to all kitchen stations
- Coordinating timing across grill, sauté, pastry, and garde manger sections
- Quality checking every dish for presentation standards and accuracy
- Communicating special requirements and modifications clearly to relevant stations
- Supporting kitchen efficiency during peak 120-cover service periods
- Maintaining visible professionalism in our open kitchen environment
- Coordinating with front of house on timing for large group bookings
- Managing dietary restriction protocols and allergen safety procedures

**Example for a fine dining establishment**

As our aboyeur, you will:

- Orchestrate complex seven-course tasting menu timing across eight specialized stations
- Maintain impeccable quality standards for every plate with precise presentation requirements
- Coordinate seamlessly with sommelier service and front of house for wine pairing timing
- Manage dietary restrictions and guest preferences with precision and discretion
- Lead kitchen communication during high-pressure 180-cover service periods
- Handle VIP guest requirements and special occasion coordination
- Maintain detailed service documentation for quality control and improvement
- Support team development through clear communication and constructive feedback

**Example for a hotel kitchen operation**

As a hotel aboyeur, your duties will include:

- Coordinating multiple service outlets including restaurant, room service, and banqueting
- Managing breakfast buffet preparation alongside à la carte lunch and dinner service
- Handling room service timing coordination with housekeeping and front desk
- Communicating with multiple front of house teams across different hotel departments
- Coordinating special event catering with banquet and conference services
- Managing inventory coordination across multiple service periods and outlets
- Handling guest special requests across all hotel dining experiences
- Supporting 24-hour service coordination with night shift team members

## Step 3: Define What Skills the Aboyeur Needs

An aboyeur requires a unique blend of culinary knowledge, communication abilities, and organisational skills. Focus on the specific skills your kitchen demands rather than generic requirements.

Building on responsibilities, the next step is recognising the skills essential for the aboyeur role. This ensures candidates have the capability required or can realistically gauge their fit for the position.

Focus directly on skills that match your venue's specific needs and avoid generic lists. Each kitchen has unique requirements based on their operations, service style, and complexity level.

**Your goal is to create a list that separates must-have skills from skills that are an advantage.**

**1. Review your task list**

Reconnect each responsibility with the skill needed to perform it well:

Example:

- If they coordinate complex timing → they need exceptional organisational and multitasking abilities
- If they quality check dishes → they need strong culinary knowledge and attention to detail
- If they manage modifications → they need problem-solving skills and menu knowledge
- If they lead kitchen communication → they require leadership skills and conflict resolution
- If they handle guest interaction → they need professional presentation and customer service abilities

**2. Divide your skills list**

- Essential Skills: Non-negotiable abilities needed from day one
- Preferred Skills: Additional skills that enhance performance but can be developed

**Key Skill Areas for Aboyeurs**

Consider these fundamental skill categories:

- Clear, confident communication under pressure
- Strong understanding of cooking techniques and timing
- Exceptional organisational and multitasking abilities
- Quality assessment and presentation standards
- Team coordination and leadership capabilities
- Problem-solving skills for service complications
- Technology proficiency for kitchen systems
- Physical stamina for long service periods

Tailor this based on your kitchen's exact requirements and service complexity.

**Example for a complex fine dining kitchen**

Essential Skills:
- Proven ability to coordinate multiple stations simultaneously
- Strong culinary knowledge including cooking times and advanced techniques
- Excellent communication skills with clear, authoritative voice
- Quality control experience with high presentation standards
- Leadership abilities to guide team performance under pressure

Preferred Skills:
- Experience with wine service coordination and sommelier communication
- Training or mentoring experience with kitchen staff development
- Familiarity with point of sale systems and kitchen display technology
- Knowledge of classical French brigade systems and terminology
- Experience with tasting menu coordination and timing complexities

**Example for a high-volume operation**

Essential Skills:
- Fast-paced communication and order management experience
- Strong organisational skills for handling high ticket volumes
- Ability to maintain quality standards under extreme pressure
- Team coordination experience in busy kitchen environments
- Physical stamina for extended service periods
- Quick decision-making abilities for service complications

Preferred Skills:
- Experience with kitchen management systems and technology integration
- Knowledge of cost control and portion management principles
- Ability to train junior kitchen staff and provide performance feedback
- Understanding of food safety and HACCP principles
- Experience with inventory management and waste reduction

**Example for a hotel kitchen environment**

Essential Skills:
- Multi-outlet coordination experience across different service styles
- Flexible communication abilities for various team personalities
- Understanding of hotel operations and guest service standards
- Ability to manage multiple service periods with different requirements
- Strong organisational skills for complex coordination demands

Preferred Skills:
- Experience with banquet and event coordination
- Knowledge of room service timing and logistics
- Understanding of hotel technology systems and integration
- Multilingual abilities for international guest service
- Experience with 24-hour operation coordination

## Step 4: Set the Experience Level

The aboyeur role demands specific experience in kitchen operations and communication. Be clear about whether you're seeking someone to train up or an experienced professional who can hit the ground running.

An essential component of your job description involves detailing the desired level of experience. This reduces mismatched expectations and allows candidates to quickly understand their suitability for the role.

However, overestimating experience requirements is a typical mistake. You may bypass capable candidates by setting undue prerequisites, particularly if you're prepared to provide on-the-job development.

**Your goal is to specify the type of kitchen experience necessary, focusing on relevant environments rather than just years.**

**1. Identify if the role is for a novice, intermediate, or highly-skilled aboyeur**

- Entry-level: No formal aboyeur experience needed; able to train someone with basic kitchen background
- Some experience: Requires prior practical experience in similar kitchen settings with coordination responsibilities
- Advanced: Looking for someone with significant aboyeur experience and capability to lead service or train peers

Be truthful about the role's nature; a simple coordination need shouldn't be mistakenly over-labelled for prestige.

**2. Specify the type of experience rather than just duration**

Instead of simply stating "2 years experience", outline important environments experienced candidates need to be familiar with. Consider:

- Do they need familiarity with high-volume, speedy kitchen services?
- Do they require previous professional brigade exposure?
- Is familiarity with specific cuisine types or cooking techniques necessary?
- Must they understand classical French brigade systems?
- Is fine dining experience with complex presentation essential?
- Do they need experience with specific technology or kitchen systems?

Detailing this delivers clarity — someone with casual dining aboyeur experience isn't the same as fine dining tasting menu coordination experience.

**3. Indicate whether training will be provided**

If open to training, highlight it clearly. Conversely, if in need of fully skilled help from day one, specify clearly.

Consider what support you can realistically provide:

- Will you offer shadowing periods with existing staff?
- Do you have structured training programmes for aboyeur skills?
- Can you provide mentorship from senior kitchen staff?
- What timeline do you expect for full competency?

**Example for intermediate recruitment**

"We seek candidates with solid kitchen experience including at least eighteen months in a busy professional environment. You should understand kitchen operations, cooking techniques, and service flow from previous roles. While we provide specific aboyeur training and mentorship, you must bring strong communication skills and kitchen confidence from the start. Experience with order coordination or senior kitchen positions is highly advantageous."

**Example for entry-level development**

"We're willing to train the right candidate with basic kitchen experience and strong communication abilities. You should have worked in a professional kitchen environment for at least six months and demonstrated leadership potential or interest in coordination roles. Comprehensive aboyeur training will be provided alongside our head chef, with structured development over three months."

**Example for experienced hiring**

"Candidates should bring minimum two years' experience in similar aboyeur or senior kitchen coordination roles. You must demonstrate proven ability to coordinate multi-station service, manage complex orders, and maintain quality standards in high-pressure environments. Experience with fine dining service, dietary restrictions management, and team leadership is essential for immediate contribution to our brigade."

**Example for specialized environment**

"We require candidates with specific hotel kitchen experience including multi-outlet coordination. Previous experience managing breakfast, à la carte, and room service coordination is essential. Understanding of hotel operations, guest service standards, and 24-hour kitchen coordination is necessary. Minimum eighteen months in similar hotel aboyeur or senior coordination roles required."

## Step 5: Describe the Personality Fit

The aboyeur role demands specific personality traits for success. This position requires someone who can command respect whilst maintaining positive team dynamics under pressure.

While technical ability is critical, the essence of long-term success lies in cultural and personal fit. This section focuses on recruiting aboyeurs who will mesh effectively with your kitchen's ethos and dynamics.

The hindrance is assembling phrases like "dedicated team player" which don't convey anything tangible to potential candidates.

Instead, clarify specific personality traits and behaviour traits that align with your kitchen environment.

**Your goal is to articulate the attitudes, energy levels, and interaction styles conducive to excelling in your team.**

**1. Reflect on your existing team dynamics**

Consider the following:

- What shared traits do high-performing team members have?
- What characteristics have not thrived in past hires?
- Does your team maintain high energy and adaptability, or a more measured approach?
- Is customer interaction part of the aboyeur's responsibilities, and if so, what tone is desired?
- What communication style works best with your current brigade?
- Do you need someone authoritative or collaborative in their leadership approach?
- How does your kitchen handle pressure and mistakes during service?
- What personality traits help during your busiest services?
- How do successful team members interact with front of house?

Craft a short list of keywords or descriptions summarising the energy and attitude desired.

**2. Be definitive, not general**

Avoid vague terms and instead illustrate this attribute in action:

- "Maintains calm authority during 200-cover services whilst encouraging team performance"
- "Provides clear direction whilst supporting team morale and individual development"
- "Adapts communication style to work effectively with different personality types across the brigade"
- "Demonstrates resilience when handling service complications without compromising team confidence"
- "Shows initiative in identifying potential problems before they affect service quality"

**3. Align personality attributes with role responsibilities**

- In intense, high-output environments: Look for calm demeanour under pressure with quick-thinking skills and stress resilience
- In relaxed, customer-engaged restaurants: Seek warmth, observational skills, and a knack for maintaining positive atmosphere
- In training-focused kitchens: Value patience, teaching abilities, and supportive communication styles

**Example for high-intensity fine dining**

"You'll excel in this role if you maintain composure under extreme pressure whilst providing clear, confident direction to your team. We value someone who commands respect through expertise rather than volume, supporting team performance whilst maintaining exacting standards. The ability to switch seamlessly between encouraging guidance and firm correction is essential. Our ideal candidate thrives on precision, enjoys mentoring others, and finds satisfaction in orchestrating complex service flawlessly."

**Example for collaborative team environment**

"This position suits someone who leads through support and clear communication. You should enjoy developing others whilst coordinating seamlessly with all team members. We value approachable leadership that maintains high standards through positive reinforcement and constructive feedback. Our kitchen culture emphasises mutual respect, continuous learning, and collective success rather than individual achievement."

**Example for high-volume operation**

"The ideal candidate thrives in fast-paced environments while maintaining attention to detail and team morale. You should possess natural organisational abilities, enjoy problem-solving under pressure, and communicate effectively with diverse personalities. We value efficiency, adaptability, and the ability to maintain quality standards even during the busiest periods."

**Tips if you're stuck**

- Consult your current staff: "What qualities do you enjoy in your colleagues?"
- Observe your current successful kitchen leaders during different service intensities
- Consider what communication styles work during your busiest periods
- Ask your team what leadership qualities they value most in coordination roles
- Reflect on past hires - what personalities succeeded or struggled in similar positions?
- Be truthful. If your environment is bustling and demanding, express the need for composure and efficiency over creativity and spontaneity
- Consider seasonal variations and how personality traits might need to adapt

## Step 6: Be Transparent About Pay and Perks

Transparency about compensation is crucial for attracting quality aboyeur candidates. This skilled position often commands higher pay than basic kitchen roles, so be clear about your offering.

This area often leaves candidates in ambiguity, yet it stands as one of the fundamental parts of a job description. Candidates need clarity on compensation and how their efforts are valued. Transparency in this step sets expectations, overturns misconceptions, and supports the engagement of committed professionals.

While not always the leader in salaries, being forthcoming regarding benefits, perks, and work culture demonstrates accountability and fosters trust.

**Be clear about:**

- The pay rate or range
- Additional benefits or perks
- What distinguishes your venue as a great workplace

**1. Make pay clear — be it hourly, salaried, or otherwise**

Specify the definite rate or present a realistic range. Guidance when unsure includes:

- Check offerings from similar establishments on platforms like Indeed, Caterer, or regional culinary boards
- Examine expectations — are you seeking junior, intermediate, or proficient aboyeurs?
- Detail experiences if pay varies — but provide a range when possible
- Consider your location and service level when setting rates
- Factor in the complexity and responsibility level of your specific role

Example:
£28,000–£32,000 annually based on experience
£14–£16/hour plus service charge distribution
£30,000 starting salary with performance reviews every six months

Avoiding terms like "competitive pay" is critical as they are vague and generally unhelpful to candidates.

**2. Highlight additional staff benefits**

Benefits beyond salary can be a draw. Consider:

- Complimentary or discounted meals and refreshments
- Paid breaks or additional training opportunities
- Well-dispersed tip pools or service charge schemes
- Regular social events with teammates
- Retirement options or healthcare benefits
- Predictable schedules or rota preferences
- Generous holiday offerings or policies
- Professional development and certification support
- Transportation assistance or parking provision
- Staff accommodation or housing support

Example:
- Complimentary meals and beverages during shifts
- Equal share of service charges (typically £2-3/hour additional)
- Paid training and professional development opportunities
- 28 days paid holiday plus bank holidays
- Staff social events and team building activities
- Consistent scheduling with two weeks advance notice
- Professional chef certification support and funding

**3. Discuss development opportunities (if available)**
