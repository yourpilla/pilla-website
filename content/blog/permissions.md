 There are three things to get your ahead around in Pilla which give you full control over what people can see and do:

 **1. Using access levels to set control:&nbsp;**Choosing whether each user is an Admin, Manager or Staff will set their level of access.**2. Using teams to set visibility:&nbsp;**Creating teams and adding users to them is the main way to control what people see.**3. Using dates to set visibility and control: **Setting custom dates is a further way you can control what staff can see and what&nbsp; management can edit.

 ## 1. Controlling access&nbsp;

 **Admin:**&nbsp;These users that can do everything in your business including changing global settings. You might only have one or two of these in the whole business and they will likely have a Director or Operations Manager type role.&nbsp;

 **Managers:**&nbsp;These users can create and edit activities but don't have access to global settings. You might have a few of these per site and they will likely have a head of department type role such as Head Chef.

 **Staff:** These users can interact with activities they can see but they can't create them and they can't access global settings You will likely have most of your employees set as this level of access.

   **Staff****Manager****Admin**  **Interact with site activities they can see**✅✅✅  **Create and edit site activities&nbsp;**❌✅✅  **Change global settings and add users**❌❌✅   ## 2. Controlling visibility with teams

 Teams are the primary way that you can control what users see. In your settings you have an option to create as many teams as you need. You should use teams to identify groups of people based on work activities. Teams can belong to one site or they can belong to all sites.&nbsp; Examples might include teams which belong to one site such as a "Kitchen Team' or a group of people who work in multiple sites such as a 'Compliance Team' or a 'Stock Taking Team'.&nbsp;

   **Staff****Manager****Admin**  **Can see activities when tagged using @**✅✅✅  **Can see activities in their teams**✅✅✅  **Can see all activities&nbsp;**❌❌✅   Once you have created your teams, you should add the right teams to every staff member, examples below. Example using a fictional business which has two sites:

 **Site 1: Townhouse has three teams which are only used in the site:**

 - Town House FOH
- Town House Kitchen
- Town House Events

 **Site 2: Park Gate has two teams&nbsp;which are only used in the site:**

 - Park Gate FOH
- Park Gate Events

 **Steve is the GM of Town House and is included in every team at his site so that he can see everything that is going on. His access level is 'Manager' so he can only see the activities related to his teams below.**

 - Town House FOH (Only available at Town House and includes the whole FOH staff)

 - Town House Kitchen (Only available at Town House and includes the whole kitchen staff)

 - Town House Events (Only available at Town House and includes a mix of FOH and kitchen staff who are involved with events)

 **Jack is the Head Chef of Town House and is only included in the Kitchen and Events Team because he doesn't need to see FOH.&nbsp;****His access level is 'Manager' so he can only see the activities related to his teams below.**

 - Town House Kitchen (Only available at Town House and includes the whole kitchen staff)

 - Town House Events (Only available at Town House and includes a mix of FOH and kitchen staff who are involved with events)

 **Jill is a Compliance Manager across both sites. She is in a Compliance Team on her own which can be used at both sites. This means Jill can move from site to site and create activities for her team. Only she will see it because she's the only person in the team.&nbsp;****Her access level is 'Manager' so she can only see the activities related to her team below.**

 - Compliance Team (Available at both sites)

 **Toby is a HR Manager across both sites. He is in a HR Team on his own which can be used at both sites. This means Toby can move from site to site and create activities for his team. Only he will see it because she's he's only person in the team.&nbsp;****His access level is 'Manager' so he can only see the activities related to her team below.&nbsp;****But Toby might want some other people to have access to his activities. For example if he does a return to work form with an employee, he wants the employee to have access to it. To do this, Tony uses @ to tag the relevant people.**

 - Compliance Team (Available at both sites)

 **Michael is the Director of the business. He needs to be able to see everything so his access level is set to 'Admin' and he can see every activity in every team and every site, regardless of which teams he has been added to.**

 ## 3. Controlling visibility with dates

 Pilla is a work planner, which uses a calendar based format. So a powerful way to control what users can see, is dates. There are two primary settings to understand:

 **1. Setting the number of days into the future that staff can see**

  This is a powerful setting which is also a huge time saver because it means that anybody with the user permission level of staff, will see a rolling number of days into the future.&nbsp;

 Some other apps (particularly shift scheduling apps) go about this is a different way. They will require you to create your schedules and then publish the schedules each time you're finished. Our solution saves you that step of publishing shifts (and other activities) because it shows the information to staff on a rolling basis.&nbsp;

 For example if you set this to 7, staff will be able to see all of their shifts and other activities for the next week, and it will always only show on week so you are free to plan further in advance than that without staff seeing it.

 **2. Setting the number of days into the past that Managers can edit**

  Manager can edit everything available to them in the future, but you wouldn't want them to be able to edit everything in the past. For example you wouldn't them to be able to edit shifts from months ago which have already gone through payroll.&nbsp;

 Again, some other apps (particularly shift scheduling apps) go about this is a different way. They will require you to&nbsp; approve shifts and then lock a week or a month each time you're finished. Our solution saves you time by automatically locking past activities which are beyond the timeframe you have set.&nbsp;

 For example if you set this to 7, Managers will be able to see all to edit activities for the last week but no further back and this will always be the case.&nbsp;

 Note* Admins can edit all site activities, future and past so be careful who you choose to have that access.

 ## Differences between the desktop planner and the mobile app

 The mobile app is used as a personalised feed for each user. Where the planner shows everything discussed in the above privacy rules, the mobile app will show less in order to provide this personalised fee experience.&nbsp;

 **Similarities with the desktop planner:**

 - Everybody sees activities for teams they are part of
- Everybody sees activities they have been tagged in
- Everybody sees activities they created (including recurring activities, so if you create a task list which recurs everyday, you'll see it everyday forever regardless of what team you are in)

 **Differences with the desktop planner:**

 - Everybody only sees their own shifts (but if you click into the shift it will tell you who&nbsp; is working in your team)
- Everybody only sees activities with an end time of the current date or after (so you can't see historical activities)
- Everybody can only see activities up to the number of days into the future that you have set for staff visibility (explained above)
- Admins only see the activities in the above similarities list (rather than every activity which is what they see on the planner)
