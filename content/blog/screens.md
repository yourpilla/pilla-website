  - DSE risk assessments are important in ensuring the safety and well-being of staff who use display screen equipment for prolonged periods. This includes computers, tablets, and other screen devices.
- You should carry out a DSE risk assessment to make sure that each group of workers in your business is using this equipment safely. If every group work under similar conditions then this could be done in one risk assessment or you may need to complete more than one risk assessment if you have different groups working under different conditions.&nbsp;It's likely that all staff in one site will work under the same conditions so it's often best practice to do a risk assessment for each site.
- Pilla&nbsp;has a pre-built display screen equipment at work risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment. 

 ## 1. Who Uses DSE Regularly at This Site?

 First, identify the roles within your business or organisation that involve regular and prolonged use of display screen equipment. These roles are typically those in office-based settings or customer service desks where screens are a fundamental part of the job.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Knowing who your regular DSE users are is crucial for targeting ergonomic improvements and health interventions. You want to ensure that each person's workstation is as safe and comfortable as possible to prevent long-term health issues like repetitive strain injuries or visual fatigue.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 It's beneficial to list specific job roles rather than individuals, as these roles often share similar risks and needs. For example:

 - Office Administrators – Routine data entry or document formatting tasks.
- Hotel Receptionists – Continuous customer checks and booking management.
- IT Support Staff – Prolonged monitoring and troubleshooting through screens.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Consider all employees within the business and determine whose roles rely heavily on computer screens:

 - Examine job descriptions and daily activity logs.
- Consult managers or department heads for insights on staff roles needing DSE access.
- Include everyone affected, even if their need for a display screen arises only occasionally but for long periods.

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “Everyone uses it occasionally.” – While this might be true for periodic tasks, focus on those whose job function specifically requires extensive use. This assessment is tailored for them.

 ## 2. Describe the DSE Setup and Working Environment

 Here, you need to detail the physical arrangement of workstations, including desk height, chair positions, monitor placement, and lighting. Consider ergonomics to prevent discomfort and promote a healthy working posture.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Improper workstation setups can lead to musculoskeletal problems, eye strain, and mental fatigue. Ensuring a well-arranged workspace tailored to individual needs mitigates these risks significantly, enhancing productivity and health.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 An effective answer addresses key ergonomic considerations:

 - Desks are at a standard height of 29 inches; adjustable desks are available for customisation.
- All chairs are adjustable, featuring lumbar support and adjustable armrests.
- Monitors are positioned at eye level, about arm’s length from user.
- Natural and artificial lighting are combined to reduce screen glare.
- Noise levels are controlled with sound-absorbent materials around DSE stations.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Go through your office or work environment:

 - Measure desk and chair heights and ensure they're appropriate for most staff. If not, list adjustments made.
- Check distances to screens and adjust for comfort.
- Evaluate lighting and reduce glare with blinds or positioning adjustments.
- Ensure a noise-moderated environment to aid concentration.

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “Every desk and chair are the same.” – Uniform setups neglect individual needs. Ensure stations are adjustable for personal comfort.

 “Monitors are placed in fixed positions without adjustment.” – Monitor placement should be flexible to accommodate personal viewing angles and reduce neck strain.

 ## 3. What Equipment is Provided to Support Safe DSE Use?

 List the additional equipment offered to help staff maintain a safe and comfortable workspace. This can include things like adjustable chairs, footrests, or monitor arms. It's also important to ensure users know how to utilise this equipment correctly.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Supportive equipment is important for ergonomics. Without it, staff are more likely to suffer from long-term issues like back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, or eye strain. Ensuring equipment is both available and properly used reduces these risks.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 Good answers should specify what’s available and how employees are educated about its use:

 - Adjustable chairs with lumbar support are standard, provided to all DSE users.
- Footrests and monitor stands are available upon request to improve alignment and comfort.
- All new employees receive setup training to use the equipment effectively.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Assess your proactive efforts to make DSE more comfortable:

 - Check whether equipment like adjustable chairs, keyboards, or footrests is available.
- Talk to users to confirm their understanding of how to set up their workstations for optimum ergonomics.
- Regularly evaluate if additional equipment is needed or if existing equipment requires replacement.

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “We have the equipment, but it’s rarely used.” – Educating users on the importance of these tools improves utilisation.

 “Once setup, equipment is left as is.” – Ongoing adjustments and training should be encouraged as needs change.

 ## 4. How is User Fatigue, Strain, or Discomfort Being Prevented?

 Indicate the measures implemented to reduce strain related to prolonged DSE usage, such as eye strain, posture issues, or repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Focus on break schedules, ergonomic adjustments, and reminders to shift positions.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Prolonged exposure to screens without breaks or ergonomic setups can lead to chronic health problems. Fatigue leads to decreased productivity and increased absenteeism due to discomfort or injury.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 A good answer details preventive steps taken:

 - Staff are encouraged to take a 5-minute break every hour to reduce eye strain.
- Posture tips and stretches are shared through monthly newsletters.
- All workstations are equipped with reminder software to ensure regular movement.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Think about your approach to limiting strain and fatigue:

 - Do you have clear policies on screen breaks?
- Are there physical or digital reminders for movement or posture checks?
- Do you share ongoing advice or encouragement for maintaining healthy DSE practices?

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “We trust staff to know when they need breaks.” – Active management of screen time and regular reminders support healthier habits.

 “We only address issues when complaints are made.” – Proactive strategies are more effective at preventing strain than reactive solutions.

 ## 5. Have Users Completed a DSE Self-Assessment?

 This step involves confirming whether employees have completed self-assessments of their workstations, how recent these assessments were, and any action plans developed from the results.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Self-assessments empower employees to identify discomfort sources and ensure personal workstations cater to their needs. They are foundational to spotting and addressing issues before they become chronic.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 A strong answer confirms participation and outcomes:

 - All DSE users completed self-assessments within the last six months.
- Assessments highlighted a need for more footrests, which have been provided.
- Adjustments are followed up by HR, recorded in personal health profiles.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Review the current status of DSE self-assessments:

 - Are all DSE users involved in self-assessments?
- What changes have been made in response to feedback?
- How are results recorded and checked for follow-up action?

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “Assessments are only completed upon request.” – Routine schedules for self-assessments ensure that potential issues are regularly checked and resolved.

 “We completed assessments several years ago.” – Regular and frequent checks are essential, as needs can change over time.

 ## 6. Are Eye Tests and Health Support Available?

 Here, explain the availability of eye tests and any additional health resources to support staff using DSE. Describe how employees are informed about their health and wellbeing entitlements.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Regular eye tests are a key part of reducing the risk of eye strain and ensuring rich screen performance does not compromise eye health. Health supports also help manage wider physical and mental aspects of prolonged screen work.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 A comprehensive answer outlines what’s available and how it's accessed:

 - All staff can access eye tests through our partnered opticians.
- Information on accessing tests and additional wellbeing resources is shared during onboarding and via the company portal.
- Monthly workshops are held focusing on stress management and other health topics.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Review your support approach:

 - Do you offer eye tests? How easy is it for staff to access this benefit?
- Is information about health support visible and understood by all employees?
- What other health resources or workshops can you offer DSE users if needed?

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “We mention it during orientation.” – Ongoing updates ensure resources are never overlooked or forgotten.

 “Few staff know or use these services.” – Promotion and transparent access to health assistance encourage use and improve staff wellness.

 ## 7. How Will You Monitor the Effectiveness of these Controls?

 Detail how you will check the success of your DSE risk control measures. This includes regular reviews, changes due to new roles, and methods used to capture feedback or discomfort reports.

 **Why It Matters:**

 Monitoring determines whether current controls are effective and helps identify when adjustments are needed. Understanding the practical impact of your strategies ensures a continuously safe working environment for staff.

 **What Good Answers Look Like:**

 Good answers offer clear plans for evaluation and adjustment:

 - DSE arrangements are reviewed annual or when significant layout changes occur.
- Feedback is collected quarterly via anonymous surveys to gauge satisfaction and discomfort levels.
- Assessment outcomes guide ongoing workstation adjustments or equipment investments.

 **How to Answer This for Yourself:**

 Consider the following:

 - How often are existing controls reviewed?
- Do you have a system for collecting staff feedback on DSE setups?
- Are outcomes from reviews shared and actioned upon?

 **Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them):**

 “We review controls if someone raises a concern.” – Regular checks should occur proactively, not just reactively.

 “We have all necessary controls, so we don’t need to review them.” – The work environment and technology evolve; frequent reassessment is key to keeping up.

 **Best Practices to Follow:**

 - Establish clear review intervals for DSE arrangements, such as annually or with team changes.
- Implement systems for feedback collection, such as surveys or suggestion boxes.
- Document adjustments made or recommended in response to reviews.
- Include DSE assessment reviews in larger health and safety audits.
