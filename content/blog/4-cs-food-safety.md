title: How to get to grips with the 4cs of food safety.
intro: >-
  This article has been written by an Environmental Health Office named Natalie
  Stanton who used to work as a health inspector for a local authority in the
  UK.&nbsp;

  The 4Cs of food safety are the big four topics of food safety that as a food
  establishment serving food you should remember. They will help to ensure good
  food hygiene which in turn will reduce the chance of food poisoning and
  food-borne illnesses.

  In my experience, food businesses that have a good understanding of the 4Cs
  manage food safety more effectively and in turn achieve a better food hygiene
  rating.  The articles that make up the food safety management system by Pilla,
  tackle each of the 4c's separately and you can find all of them by scrolling
  down to the bottom of this page or using the header menu. In this article, my
  aim is to explain what each of the four categories means and for each I'll
  share a key thing that an Environmental Health Officer (EHO) may check/ expect
  to see during your inspection.
