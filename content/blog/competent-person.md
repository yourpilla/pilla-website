So who's in charge of keeping everyone safe and healthy at work? In the UK, the law says you need a 'competent person' to help you meet health and safety duties. This could be you, someone already working for you, or an outside professional you hire. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 say you must appoint one or more competent people to help you comply with health and safety laws. Makes sense, right? You want someone who knows their stuff when it comes to spotting risks and finding ways to control them. Plus, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 requires you to have access to competent health and safety advice, whether that's in-house or external. It's all about making sure you've got the right knowledge and support to keep your workplace safe.

In the US, OSHA's OSH Act of 1970 also says employers are responsible for providing a safe work environment. While it doesn't specifically require a designated 'competent person', you still need to make sure you've got the expertise to identify and control hazards. The bottom line? Having a competent person on board is a key part of managing health and safety, no matter which side of the pond you're on. They'll help you stay on top of legal duties, spot risks, and put the right measures in place to protect your people.

## Health and Safety Competent Persons Arrangements

Unless competent staff and management team are employed internally or externally, compliance with legislative requirements or food hygiene rating scheme will not be achieved.

Your company must appoint competent persons to assist in undertaking the measures needed to ensure compliance with the requirements and prohibitions imposed under current, relevant statutory laws and regulations.

You must recognise recognise that a competent person must have the knowledge and experience to succeed in the role given by the organisation regardless of whether that is at senior or junior levels. Those recognised by Responsible Persons as having the experience and capability but may not have the knowledge and qualifications will not be discounted from progressing within the company. 

Sufficient time and resources will be allocated to the competent persons to allow them to properly undertake the roles assigned, which means providing the training, instruction, and information necessary to succeed.
