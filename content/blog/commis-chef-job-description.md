## Step 1: Describe Your Kitchen Environment in the Introduction

 An introduction that highlights your restaurant's uniqueness helps set clear expectations for potential candidates. Whether describing for new job postings or reminding current staff, this section should capture the essence of your kitchen’s working environment.

 **Your goal is to help the candidate quickly understand:**

- What your restaurant’s dining style is

- The type of cuisine you specialise in

- What working in your kitchen feels like

 Use this simple 3-part structure to get started:

 **1. What type of restaurant are you?**

 Begin with a clear label: “We’re a fine dining restaurant / a bustling bistro / a family-run eatery / a seasonal farm-to-table venue…”

 **2. What’s your culinary approach?**

 Explain your service style and dining experience. For instance:

- “We deliver high-end French cuisine with a modern twist, focusing on precision and presentation.”

- “We’re a lively, casual diner offering a mix of traditional and innovative British dishes.”

- “Our focus is on local, organic produce incorporated into a dynamic menu.”

 **3. What makes your kitchen unique or appealing to work in?**

 This could be your kitchen culture, team ethos, or culinary principles. For instance:

- “Close-knit team that values creativity and innovation.”

- “Dedicated to sustainable practises and reducing food waste.”

- “Chefs take part in regular workshops and tastings to enhance skills.”

 **Tips if you’re unsure what to write**

 If you're struggling to find the words, consider these questions aloud first:

- What are your restaurant's busiest times?

- Is the kitchen fast-paced or more relaxed and methodical?

- What technical equipment is used in your kitchen?

- What do chefs appreciate most about working here?

 Be authentic in your description — there's no need to embellish.

 **Example 1: High-end Fine Dining Restaurant**

 We’re a gourmet French restaurant that prides itself on exquisite presentation and impeccable service. Our team thrives in a high-pressure environment, focusing on creating memorable dining experiences with every dish. We frequently update our menu with seasonal ingredients sourced locally.

 **Example 2: Casual Neighbourhood Bistro**

 We’re a friendly, family-run bistro serving hearty British favourites in a casual atmosphere. Our chefs collaborate closely to create comforting dishes with a twist. Emphasising teamwork and creativity, we provide a platform for growing culinary skills and experimenting with new recipes.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Commis Chef

 A well-crafted list of responsibilities is vital, as it aligns candidates' expectations with the realities of working in your kitchen. Avoid vague terminology and focus on duties unique to your establishment's operation.

 **Your goal is to develop a task list that truly reflects the workings of your kitchen.**

 List 6–10 bullet points detailing what the commis chef's role entails in your culinary setting. This should encompass routine, everyday tasks and be communicated clearly.

 Divide responsibilities into preparation, service, and closing duties:

 **1. Preparation and Mise en Place**

 These duties are typically performed before the restaurant opens or during early shifts.

 Consider these questions:

- Who organises the kitchen and ensures readiness for service?

- What equipment and ingredients should be prepared?

 Examples include:

- Sorting and prepping ingredients as per recipes

- Maintaining equipment and workstations' cleanliness

- Setting up required kitchen stations and equipment

- Completing prep tasks as assigned by senior chefs

 **2. Service Responsibilities**

 These tasks relate to in-service operations and collaboration with the team.

 Consider these questions:

- Is the commis chef involved in cooking during service?

- How do they support the head and sous chefs?

 Examples include:

- Assisting with dish plating and garnishing during peak hours

- Facilitating communication between kitchen stations

- Following sanitation and safety procedures meticulously

 **3. Cleaning and Closing Includes**

 End-of-service responsibilities and cleanliness are crucial daily tasks.

 Consider these questions:

- Who is responsible for cleaning and maintaining the kitchen?

- What cleaning tasks are expected post-service?

 Examples include:

- Cleaning and sanitising stations and equipment

- Restocking pantry and kitchen supplies for the next day

- Assisting with kitchen waste management and recycling

 **If you already have Commis Chefs but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe Them on Shift: Watch how they manage tasks like ingredient prep, dish support, and cleaning routines

- Request Their Input: Ask for a daily duties list to document their regular tasks

- Consult Supervisors: Gather insights from head or sous chefs about the commis chef's contributions

 Useful questions to ask your Commis Chefs:

- What prep tasks are you responsible for each shift?

- During service, how do you assist the senior chefs?

- Which cleaning duties do you complete to maintain kitchen standards?

- How do you manage coordination with other kitchen staff?

- What opportunities do you have for learning advanced culinary skills here?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Consult preparation and cleanup checklists for insights

- Consider what areas often encounter challenges and ensure they are clearly outlined

 **Example for a Fine Dining Venue**

 As a commis chef, your duties will cover:

- Assisting with ingredient preparation and mise en place before service

- Executing tasks to support the head and sous chefs during operations

- Ensuring all kitchen equipment is properly cleaned and ready for the next shift

- Maintaining a high standard of hygiene and kitchen organisation

 **Example for a Fast-Paced Bistro**

 As a commis chef, you will be responsible for:

- Prepping fresh ingredients quickly and accurately

- Collaborating with chefs to ensure seamless kitchen flow during peak hours

- Cleaning work areas and restocking ingredients after service

- Upholding health and safety standards at all times

## Step 3: Specify the Required Skills for Your Commis Chef

 Now that responsibilities are established, determine the skills the commis chef must have to thrive in your kitchen.

 This assists applicants in evaluating their fit and helps streamline the application process. Tailor your skills list to reflect your kitchen’s specific operations.

 **Your goal is to create a concise yet comprehensive list of essential and preferred skills aligned with actual needs.**

 **1. Review your responsibilities list**

 For each responsibility, ask yourself:

 “What skill is crucial for this to be performed effectively?”

 Example:

- Prepping ingredients → must have basic knife skills

- Following hygiene procedures → good understanding of kitchen safety

 **2. Organise your skills into two lists**

- Must-have skills: Non-negotiables needed from day one

- Nice-to-have skills: Helpful but not essential; can be developed on the job

 **Consider common skills such as:**

- Basic culinary techniques and knife handling

- Food safety and hygiene knowledge

- Team communication and collaborative skills

- Multitasking capabilities during busy service periods

- Attention to detail and presentation

 Focus on what's truly necessary for your setup.

 **Example for a high-end kitchen**

 Must-Have Skills

- Sound understanding of basic culinary techniques

- Ability to follow precise recipes and presentation standards

- Strong knowledge of food safety and hygiene practices

- Clear communication with team members

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Familiarity with modern cooking techniques or equipment

- Interest in learning advanced culinary skills

 **Example for a casual dining restaurant**

 Must-Have Skills

- Good knife skills and understanding of basic food prep

- Adaptability in a fast-paced kitchen environment

- Commitment to cleanliness and organisation

- Effective team communication

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Experience with seasonal menu adaptations

- Desire to learn and grow in a culinary career

## Step 4: Determine the Experience Level Required

 After outlining the necessary skills, specify how much real-life experience the candidate should have. This prevents mismatched expectations and helps candidates assess their suitability.

 Avoid demanding more experience than the position justifies. Ensure your requirements align with the true needs of the role.

 **Your goal is to clearly define the level of experience needed — not just the duration, but the type of kitchen exposure required.**

 **1. Categorize the role: trainee, experienced, or senior**

- Trainee-level: Open to individuals with minimal or no kitchen experience, willing to learn.

- Mid-level: Requires solid experience within a similar culinary setting.

- Senior: Demands leadership, oversight, and advanced expertise.

 State your true expectations for transparency and clarity.

 **2. Focus on experience type, not duration**

 Rather than specifying “1 year’s experience,” describe the setting needed. Consider:

- Do they need experience in a high-volume or fine-dining setting?

- Have they used specific equipment or cooking methods?

 Detailing specifics prevents incompatible applications.

 **3. State whether training is provided or required**

 Clarify if training is available or if the candidate must be fully prepared to handle tasks independently.

 **Example for a trainee-friendly environment**

 "No professional experience needed — enthusiasm for cooking and a keen willingness to learn are enough. We provide comprehensive training in our kitchen procedures, ingredients, and equipment."

 **Example for an experienced commis chef**

 "We’re seeking candidates with at least 6 months of hands-on kitchen experience in a similar environment. Candidates should competently execute their role in support of senior chefs during busy service times."

 **Example for a senior role**

 "Applicants must have 1+ year’s experience in an upscale culinary setting, able to manage specific stations and support junior chefs. Extensive knowledge of kitchen operations is essential."

## Step 5: Define Personality and Cultural Fit Required

 Besides skills, finding a personality that meshes well with your team ensures a positive work environment. This part of the description helps attract candidates who will thrive in your kitchen.

 Many companies write generic phrases like “team player” or “reliable,” but those don’t convey what’s special about your kitchen’s vibe.

 **Your objective is to explain the attitude, energy, and communication style that suits your kitchen team.**

 **1. Identify what's working well in your team**

 Ask yourself:

- What do successful team members have in common?

- Which personalities adapt best in your kitchen?

- Is the atmosphere high-energy or laid-back and steady?

- How is communication handled during service?

 Document keywords or phrases capturing the essence of your team’s dynamics.

 **2. Specify actions, not vague terms**

 Instead of just using “team player,” illustrate what this involves. For example:

- “Readily assists with tasks during peak times.”

- “Keeps open communication to streamline kitchen efficiency.”

- “Engages positively with colleagues to foster a cooperative atmosphere.”

 **3. Consider the role’s pressure levels**

- For fast-paced kitchens: seek focused individuals who handle stress well.

- For slower yet attentive environments: choose warm and insightful personalities.

 **Example for a high-pressure kitchen**

 "Those who succeed here stay cool under pressure, adapt quickly to fast-paced conditions, and prioritize clear communication. Our team values resourcefulness and positivity, especially during peak service hours."

 **Example for a community-focused kitchen**

 "Our ideal candidates are friendly and empathic, often relishing customer stories and food preferences. Supporting team efforts and maintaining a spirited presence, they bring joy to culinary creation. A passion for food and service is highly valued."

 **Tips if you’re unsure**

- Ask your team, “What type of people blend well in our kitchen?”

- Identify why past hires have thrived or struggled — learn what worked or missed the mark.

- Stay honest. If your kitchen is demanding, emphasize the need for resilience and focus, not simply creativity.

## Step 6: Clarify Pay and Benefits

 It's important to share pay and benefits upfront. Candidates appreciate knowing what to expect financially and the perks that come with the job. Being open about compensation builds trust and attracts serious, suitable applicants.

 Even if the pay isn’t the highest, outlining the full range of benefits and the overall work environment boosts your appeal.

 **Clearly convey:**

- The pay rate or range

- Benefits beyond salary

- What makes your workplace special

 **1. Be specific about pay — hourly or salaried**

 Outline the precise rate or realistic range. If unsure:

- Research local trends for similar roles

- Weigh your requirements against the market

- If reliant on experience, provide a range with conditions

 Avoid generic terms like “competitive pay” — specificity builds rapport.

 **2. List any staff benefits**

 Perks, even small ones, matter. Think outside of strict pay:

- Complimentary or reduced-price meals on shift

- Health and safety support resources

- Inclusive tip distribution

- Opportunities for skill-building and career growth

- Flexible scheduling where possible

- Comprehensive leave options

 **3. Mention progression opportunities (if applicable)**

 If you're fostering growth or professional development, make it known.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £20,000–£23,000 per year based on experience.Tips: Shared equally among the team.

 Benefits include:

- Complimentary meals and beverages during shifts

- 28 days holiday leave (including bank holidays)

- Customised ongoing training sessions

- Opportunities for progression within the kitchen hierarchy

- Supportive team atmosphere fostering personal and professional development

 **Tips if you’re considering options**

- Reflect on: “What keeps employees engaged with this role?”

- Maintain honesty — promise what’s feasible and worthwhile

- If your pay is moderate, accentuate unique workplace strengths (learning opportunities, supportive culture, career advancement potential, etc.)
