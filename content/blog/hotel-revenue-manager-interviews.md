Step 1: Define What You're Looking For
Focus on analytical thinking, commercial instincts, and cross-functional collaboration over just technical skills. Separate essential traits (pricing strategy, forecasting ability) from nice extras (advanced certifications, multi-property experience). If you need clarity, check our article on [hotel revenue manager job descriptions.](https://yourpilla.com/blog/hotel-revenue-manager-job-description)

Step 2: Plan the Interview Structure
Choose format based on hotel complexity and revenue challenges:
- Standard: Commercial assessment plus scenario-based challenges for most roles
- Extended: Include strategic planning and advanced analytics for senior positions
- Comprehensive: Add multi-department collaboration for complex operations

Step 3: Develop Leadership and Scenario-Based Questions
Ask for specific examples: optimising pricing during low demand, collaborating with sales teams, implementing revenue strategies. Focus on commercial thinking and adaptability over perfect technical knowledge.

Step 4: Plan Revenue Management Trial Activities
Test analytical skills, pricing decisions, and strategic thinking. 90-120 minutes reveals commercial instincts and problem-solving approach. Watch for data interpretation, collaboration skills, and guest-focused solutions.

Step 5: Evaluate Fairly and Consistently
Weight commercial thinking (40%), analytical ability (35%), and collaboration skills (25%). Avoid personality-based hiring. Document specific examples for each score to compare candidates fairly.

## Step 1. Define What You're Looking For

Hotel revenue manager roles vary significantly between properties, so you must understand your specific commercial challenges and operational complexity before interviewing anyone. A revenue manager at a luxury resort faces different challenges than someone at a business hotel or boutique property.

**Your goal is to identify the exact combination of analytical thinking, commercial instincts, and collaborative skills your hotel needs to maximise revenue whilst maintaining guest satisfaction.**

Use this systematic approach to clarify your requirements:

**1. Analyse Your Hotel's Revenue Complexity and Market Position**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We need a revenue manager who can optimise pricing across 300 rooms whilst coordinating with events and F&B revenue streams / require someone who can implement dynamic pricing strategies whilst maintaining our luxury positioning / need expertise in group bookings and corporate negotiations for our business-focused property..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What's the size and complexity of your property and revenue streams?
- Do you operate in competitive markets requiring sophisticated pricing strategies?
- Are you managing seasonal variations or year-round consistent demand?
- What's your mix of leisure, business, and group bookings?
- Do you need integration with multiple distribution channels and OTAs?

**2. Define Your Commercial Philosophy and Revenue Strategy**

Your revenue manager requirements change based on property positioning and commercial objectives:

- "Our luxury resort emphasises premium positioning and guest experience, requiring a revenue manager who can optimise rates whilst maintaining brand standards and guest satisfaction."

- "We operate a business-focused hotel where the revenue manager must maximise corporate bookings whilst managing dynamic pricing strategies and competitor positioning."

- "Our boutique property values personalised service, needing a revenue manager who can balance revenue optimisation with flexible booking policies and guest relationship management."

- "We focus on events and group business, seeking a revenue manager who can coordinate complex pricing strategies across multiple revenue streams whilst supporting sales efforts."

**3. Establish Priority Balance for Your Property Type**

Different hotels require different revenue management priorities:

| **Property Type** | **Analytical Skills** | **Commercial Thinking** | **Collaboration** | **Strategic Planning** |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Luxury Resort | 85% | 90% | 80% | 85% |
| Business Hotel | 90% | 95% | 85% | 80% |
| Boutique Property | 80% | 85% | 90% | 75% |
| Group/Events Hotel | 85% | 90% | 95% | 85% |
| Extended Stay | 85% | 85% | 80% | 80% |

**Enhanced Requirements Framework:**

| **Attribute** | **Must-Have** | **Nice-to-Have** | **Property Type Priority** |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Strong analytical and data interpretation skills | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Commercial thinking and pricing strategy expertise | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Cross-functional collaboration and communication | ✅ |  | All properties |
| Revenue management system proficiency | ✅ |  | All properties |

| Group and corporate sales coordination |  | ✅ | Business hotels, event properties |
| Competitive intelligence and market analysis | ✅ |  | Competitive markets |
| Budget planning and financial analysis |  | ✅ | Independent properties, senior roles |

**4. Consider Your Technology and Support Infrastructure**

**Revenue Stream Complexity:**
