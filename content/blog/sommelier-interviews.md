Step 1: Define What You're Looking For
Focus on wine expertise, guest engagement skills, and sales ability over just tasting credentials. Separate essential traits (pairing knowledge, guest education) from nice extras (advanced certifications, rare wine experience). If you need clarity, check our article on [sommelier job descriptions.](https://yourpilla.com/blog/sommelier-job-description)

Step 2: Plan the Interview Structure
Choose format based on establishment sophistication:
- Standard: Wine knowledge assessment plus service scenarios for most roles
- Extended: Include program development and staff training for senior positions
- Comprehensive: Add strategic planning for wine director roles

Step 3: Develop Leadership and Scenario-Based Questions
Ask for specific examples: educating hesitant guests, handling wine complaints, building wine sales. Focus on hospitality instincts and commercial awareness over technical perfection.

Step 4: Plan Wine Service Trial Activities
Test knowledge application, guest interaction, and sales skills. 90-120 minutes reveals expertise and service approach. Watch for confidence, adaptability, and genuine passion.

Step 5: Evaluate Fairly and Consistently
- Weight wine expertise (40%)
- Guest service (35%), 
- Sales capability (25%). 
Avoid personality-based hiring. Document specific examples for each score to compare candidates fairly.

## Step 1. Define What You're Looking For

Sommelier roles vary significantly between establishments, so you must understand your specific wine program needs and guest expectations before interviewing anyone. A sommelier in a Michelin-starred restaurant faces different challenges than someone at a casual wine bar or hotel operation.

**Your goal is to identify the exact combination of wine expertise, guest engagement skills, and commercial instincts your establishment needs to enhance dining experience and drive wine revenue.**

Use this systematic approach to clarify your requirements:

**1. Analyse Your Wine Program's Scope and Guest Demographics**

Be specific about your operational reality: "We need a sommelier who can guide nervous diners through our 300-bottle list whilst maintaining approachable service / require someone who can elevate our natural wine program whilst educating staff and guests / need expertise in champagne and premium spirits for our cocktail-focused venue..."

Consider these operational factors that impact your requirements:

- What's the size and complexity of your wine list and inventory?
- Do guests typically need guidance or are they wine-sophisticated?
- Are you operating fine dining service or casual wine education?
- What's your average wine price point and guest spending patterns?
- Do you need wine program development and staff training coordination?

**2. Define Your Service Philosophy and Wine Culture**

Your sommelier requirements change based on establishment concept and guest expectations:

- "Our fine dining restaurant emphasises wine as integral to the culinary experience, requiring a sommelier who can provide expert guidance whilst maintaining refined, educational service that elevates guest satisfaction."

- "We operate a wine-focused bistro where the sommelier must create engaging, accessible wine experiences whilst driving sales through passionate recommendations and enthusiastic guest education."

- "Our hotel operation values consistent, professional wine service, needing a sommelier who can adapt to diverse guest preferences whilst coordinating wine programs across multiple outlets."

- "We focus on emerging wine regions and natural producers, seeking a sommelier who can educate guests about innovative winemaking whilst building loyalty through authentic, knowledgeable service."

**3. Establish Priority Balance for Your Establishment Type**

Different establishments require different sommelier priorities:

| **Establishment Type** | **Wine Expertise** | **Guest Service** | **Sales Ability** | **Program Development** |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|

| Wine Bar/Bistro | 85% | 95% | 90% | 70% |
| Hotel Restaurant | 80% | 90% | 80% | 75% |
| Casual Fine Dining | 75% | 90% | 85% | 60% |
| Private Club | 85% | 85% | 70% | 80% |

**Enhanced Requirements Framework:**

**Your goal is to understand how candidates approach wine service, handle guest challenges, and contribute to wine sales through specific examples from their experience.**
