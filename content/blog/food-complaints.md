Effective complaint handling is essential, not only to resolve issues promptly but also to uphold the reputation of your business. Various types of customer complaints, from general grievances about service or food quality to serious allegations of food poisoning or allergen incidents, may occur so you need to know how to deal with each.&nbsp;

 ## General complaints

 Listen carefully to the nature of the complaint by the customer, it is very important that we keep customers happy so that they will return.

 Different types of complaints should be dealt with in separate ways.

 Genuine complaints could include things such as being given dirty cutlery to food that is cold or poorly cooked, or possibly even the quality of the product not up to standard. These types of complaints can be dealt with easily, they indicate that some of our systems are slightly out of control. To keep the customer happy, simple corrective actions can bring everything back to the status quo.

 Example. Dirty cutlery could indicate that the dishwasher is not working correctly, or possibly that the machine is not being racked properly or that staff are not being vigilant when laying cutlery onto the tables. These are easily rectified by maintenance of equipment and training for kitchen porters and waiting staff.
