## Step 1: Start with Your Kitchen's Environment

 When writing your kitchen job description to attract a new candidate, the first thing you need to tell the reader about your kitchen environment. This brief introduction helps potential hires picture themselves working there and understand if the environment suits them.

 **Your goal is to inform the candidate about:**

- The kitchen dynamic and structure

- The pace and intensity of the kitchen operations

- The most standout aspects of working in your kitchen

 Use this 3-part approach:

 **1. Define Your Kitchen Type**

 Give a clear description: “We run a gourmet restaurant kitchen / are a large hotel catering service / provide high-volume event catering...”

 **2. Describe the Kitchen's Operational Style**

 Define the kitchen's rhythm and team interactions. For example:

- “We maintain a bustling, high-energy kitchen catering to large group bookings.”

- “Our focus is on detailed preparation with a steady pace and precision cooking.”

- “We support varied dietary needs with efficient prep and service.”

 **3. Highlight Unique and Appealing Features**

 Showcase your kitchen's benefits and culture. This might include:

- “Our team benefits from collaborative meal prep techniques.”

- “We practise sustainable cooking methods and resource management.”

- “We offer opportunities for team members to learn new cooking skills.”

- “Our kitchen prides itself on innovation and teamwork.”

 **Tips if you’re unsure**

 To get started, try answering these questions:

- How does a typical day unfold in your kitchen?

- How many meals do you generally serve daily?

- Do you focus on à la carte, buffet, or both?

- What is your team’s dynamic during service – highly structured or flexible?

- Do kitchen staff rotate stations or focus on one area?

- What makes staff enjoy working at your venue?

 Be honest in portraying your setup; authenticity wins the right candidates.

 **Example 1: High-Pressure Catering Kitchen**

 We're a bustling event catering service, crafting 500+ dishes daily for events and private functions. Our team thrives in maintaining speed without compromising on quality. We utilise high-tech kitchen equipment to streamline prep processes and ensure excellent results.

 **Example 2: Boutique Hotel Kitchen**

 We're a boutique hotel with a tranquil kitchen environment focusing on exquisite dish presentation and meticulous ingredient handling. Our team is small yet supportive, ensuring every dish is made to delight our guests. We rotate menus seasonally, promoting creativity and attention to detail.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Kitchen Porter

 It's crucial for job descriptions to be specific here. Avoid vague phrases like “assist chefs” and create a detailed list of actual tasks. This ensures prospective porters know what’s expected and can judge their suitability clearly.

 **Your goal is to tailor the list to your kitchen's specific routines and needs.**

 Write 6–10 bullet points to clarify the role within the context of your kitchen. Segment the role into three parts for clarity:

 **1. Prepping and Setup Responsibilities**

 These are tasks before or at shift start. Consider:

- Who prepares the kitchen stations?

- What needs washing, cutting, or prepping first?

 Common examples include:

- Organising ingredients and stock for upcoming service

- Checking equipment is clean and functioning properly

- Performing basic food prep such as peeling or chopping veggies

- Setting up cleaning stations for easy access during shifts

 **2. Service Responsibilities**

 Outline tasks managed during meal preparation and service. Ask yourself:

- Which areas require assistance the most?

- Do they assist with food preparation or only cleaning?

- Are they responsible for restocking during busy periods?

 These tasks might include:

- Efficiently washing dishes and returning them for reuse

- Assisting with basic prep, like salads or side dishes

- Handling waste management and maintaining a tidy environment

- Supporting chefs by fetching and sorting ingredients

 **3. Clean-up and Closing Responsibilities**

 Involves tasks at the end of shifts to ensure readiness for future use. Consider:

- Who is in charge of equipment sanitation?

- What cleaning tasks are assigned?

 Duties might encompass:

- Sterilising equipment and deep cleaning workspace

- Organising storage areas for next day operations

- Managing waste disposal according to kitchen guidelines

- Ensuring all cleaning equipment is stored properly

 **If you have kitchen porters but no written duties, you can:**

- Observe them during shifts: Take note of their management of tools, stations, and clean-up tasks.

- Gather their insights: Ask them to list daily tasks and contributions they regularly manage.

- Consult with chefs: Gain input on the porters' support roles during service.

 Key questions to ask your Kitchen Porters might be:

- What routines and tasks do you prioritize before service begins?

- How do you maintain cleanliness and sanitation standards during your shift?

- What practices do you follow for recycling or waste management?

- How do you help facilitate communication and support between chefs?

 **Tips if you’re unsure**

- Ask an existing staff member to outline a typical day

- Use operation checklists you have in place as a guide

- Concentrate on what areas break down when things go awry to address those directly

 **Example for a small, focused kitchen**

 As a kitchen porter, your responsibilities will include:

- Assisting with vegetable prep and organising ingredients

- Promptly washing and restocking kitchen tools and dishes

- Supporting kitchen cleanliness and safety standards throughout service

- Working closely with chefs to ensure smooth workflow

- Managing end-of-shift organisation and equipment sanitation

 **Example for a large hotel kitchen**

 As a kitchen porter, your duties will include:

- Handling dish and pans cleaning during high-volume service

- Supporting back-of-house stock management and restocking

- Executing kitchen waste sorting and disposal tasks

- Assisting with bulk prep activities during peak times

- Completing daily checks and closing tasks for nice, clean start tomorrow

## Step 3: Define What Skills the Kitchen Porter Needs

 Building on responsibilities, the next step is recognising the skills essential for the Kitchen Porter role. This ensures candidates have the capability required or can realistically gauge their fit for the position.

 Focus directly on skills that match your venue’s specific needs and avoid generic lists. Each kitchen has unique requirements based on their operations.

 **Your goal is to create a list that separates must-have skills from skills that are an advantage.**

 **1. Review your task list**

 Reconnect each responsibility with the skill needed to perform it well:

 Example:  
 
- If they manage dishwashing effectively → they require efficiency and time management skills

- If they maintain stock levels → they need organisation and attention to detail

- If they assist chefs with prep → they need basic cooking knowledge

 **2. Divide your skills list**

- Essential Skills

 Non-negotiable; candidates must possess these from the start.

- Preferred Skills

 Additional skills that are beneficial but can be taught.

 **Key Skill Areas to Consider**

- Effective dishwashing and organisation

- Stock handling and inventory basics

- Maintaining hygiene and sanitation practices

- Positive teamwork and open communication

- Basic prep support for chefs

 Tailor this based on your kitchen’s exact requirements.

 **Example for a detailed prep-focused kitchen**

 Essential Skills

- Basic food preparation knowledge

- Strong cleaning skills and attention to detail

- Ability to handle high-pressure loads efficiently

- Effective communication and teamwork

 **Preferred Skills**

- Knowledge of professional kitchen operations

- Cooking experience

- Experience in recycling and waste management best practices

 **Example for a large, high-volume kitchen**

 Essential Skills

- Strong dishwashing speed and efficiency

- Prior experience with stock and inventory management

- Adherence to hygiene and cleanliness standards

- Excellent multitasking ability

 **Preferred Skills**

- Experience with high-volume restaurant operations

- Advanced food preparation and ingredient knowledge

- Capacity to support with basic food service tasks

 Creating a task-specific skills list ensures candidates understand what is expected and if a fit, can readily step into your kitchen's workflow.

## Step 4: Define Experience Levels Required

 With skills covered, you now need to clarify how much experience candidates should have. This eliminates mismatches and streamlines the hiring process by attracting suitable candidates who meet or exceed the experience bar.

 Appropriately stating the experience needed is crucial. Don't aim too high when you’ll offer training — this excludes potentially great hires who are keen to learn.

 **Your goal is to be open about the exact type of experience necessary, based on your kitchen setup.**

 **1. Identify if the role is for newbies, some experience, or highly-skilled**

- Entry-level: No formal experience needed; able to train in-house.

- Some experience: Requires prior practical experience in similar settings.

- Advanced: Looking for someone with significant experience and capability to lead areas or train peers.

 Be truthful about the role’s nature; a simple need shouldn't be mistakenly over-labelled for prestige.

 **2. Specify the type of experience rather than just duration**

 Instead of simply stating “1 year experience”, outline important environments experienced candidates need to be familiar with. Consider:

- Do they need familiarity with high-volume, speedy kitchen services?

- Do they require previous professional kitchen exposure?

- Is familiarity with industrial equipment necessary?

 Detailing this delivers clarity — someone with factory kitchen machine experience isn’t the same as a small café kitchen experience.

 **3. Indicate whether training will be provided**

 If open to training, highlight it. Conversely, if in need of fully skilled help from day one, specify clearly.

 **Example for mid-level recruitment**

 “We’re searching for individuals who’ve gained hands-on experience in a bustling professional kitchen. You should be adept with dishwashing protocol, familiar with stock management, and uphold hygiene standards consistently. While we offer skill-building opportunities, readiness for service from the onset is expected.”

 **Example for novices**

 “No previous experience needed — just a solid work ethic and willingness to learn underpinning kitchen tasks. Training is provided to integrate you into our kitchen's workflow efficiently.”

 **Example for advanced roles**

 “Candidates should bring a minimum of 2 years' experience within a high-paced commercial kitchen, showcasing excel in dish area supervision and participation in basic prep roles. Experience mentoring fellow kitchen porters or maintaining kitchen stock rotation is advantageous.”

## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 Beyond skills, finding the right personality fit is paramount. It’s essential that hires find enjoyment in their roles and contribute positively to your kitchen's atmosphere.

 A common error is sticking to vague traits like “motivated team worker”. These do little to nuance your expectation or offer candidates any substance.

 Instead, specify concrete personal qualities and behaviours that meld with your kitchen team.

 **Your goal is to clearly detail the type of attitude, energy, and collaboration style conducive to success in your kitchen.**

 **1. Consider existing helpful team dynamics**

 Reflect on:

- Traits shared by your standout team members?

- Personalities proving challenging within your workspace?

- Does your team pulse with energy or prioritise steady, quiet focus?

- Is staff-cook interaction minimal and clean-cut, or more inclusive and team-driven?

 Jot down key traits mirroring the vibe you want maintained.

 **2. Be precise, moving past superficiality**

 Switch phrases like “communicative” for vivid, illustrative actions. Such as:

- “Proactively supports team duties, especially during peak times”

- “Communicates gaps in supplies for seamless restocking”

- “Looks for chances to ease workload of peers effectively”

 **3. Ensure personality aligns with job intensity**

- If fast-paced settings dominate: a candidate should manage stress, organise shifts efficiently.

- If a softer pace is common: you seek warmth, observational skills, and willingness to guide.

 **Example for lively kitchen support role**

 "This role favours those adept under routine tasks, possessing an adaptable approach, and responsive to sudden task pickups. Our members strive to excel, so forward-thinkers and problem-solvers are highly valued."

 **Example for an orchestrated kitchen team**

 "An ideal fit radiates energy for helping others, has diligent oversight in detail, and a practical perspective. We value members keen on complementing peers in smooth service delivery, achieving culinary goals both as individuals and a collective team."

 **Tips if you’re lost**

- Consult staff attitudes: What personalities match our daily operations?

- Reassess previous hiring outcomes: What didn’t align previously?

- Stay truthful. If your kitchen’s undertone is high-tension, embed personalities who remedy that, not foster chaos.

## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 Though many hesitate to elaborate here, this is crucial for interested candidates. Transparency saves unnecessary back-and-forth, attracting suitable prospects swiftly.

 Offering clarity establishes credibility. This tasks’ most important step involves sharing full detail on pay, benefits, and encompassing specifics of the role environment.

 **State clearly and explicitly:**

- Range of pay — whether hourly or salaried

- Additional perks or benefits

- What distinguishes your kitchen's offer

 **1. Clearly note salary or wage rates**

 Ensure it’s upfront — precise or range-based. Explore regional averages if uncertain:.

- Review what comparable roles within vicinity offer (local platforms like Indeed or industry forums)

- Weigh over your expectations — trainee or experienced?

- If dependent on experience, state that via a justified range.

 Example:  
 
£10.50–£11.50 per hour based on experience  
£10.80/hour including breakdowns, tips reviewed in assigned reviews" Avoid “competitive pay” — it offers candidates no beneficial knowledge.

 **2. Detail any available benefits or perks**

 Even modest benefits can sway decisions. Think beyond typical wage:

- Meal or refreshment provision on-the-job

- Breaks, training or assessment payments

- Shared gratuities or bonus schemes

- Team involvement with social gatherings or activities

- Staff mental health or supportive schemes

- Varied rota or shift pattern allowances

- Increased paid vacation (where offered)

 Example:

- Meal and refreshment support during shifts

- Paid rest breaks and holiday

- Opportunity for skill development and enhancement

- Participatory gratuities shared to all

- Consistent kitchen environment without disruptive hustle into the night

 **3. Describe any growth or development opportunities (if available)**

 If providing structured training, mentorship, or opportunities for senior progression, note these aspects positively.

 Example:

 We encourage personal development with comprehensive skill-building opportunities, SCA certification potential, and pathway to senior support team roles accessible.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £10.50–£11.50 per hour based on experience  Tips: Pro-rata and shared collectively (regular tracking ~£1-2/hr extra) Benefits:

- Provided meals and drinks on shifts

- Paid holiday covering work weeks

- Progressive skill-building and enhancement

- A dedicated focus on team learning and involvement

- Consistent day/evening timetable structures with no lateness

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask yourself: “What attracts retention and loyalty to this role?”

- Be forthcoming — avoid inflating details over promises

- Highlight beneficial specifics like a balanced work/life set-up or flexible conditions if pay scale is lower end
