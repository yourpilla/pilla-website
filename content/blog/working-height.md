  - Working at height activities, such as changing light bulbs or retrieving items from high shelves, pose significant risks. According to The Work at Height Amendment Regulations (2007), employers must ensure all work at height is safely planned and supervised.
- You should carry out several working at height risk assessments by grouping activities together. For example, all low risk activities which use a simple step ladder be grouped together because they are similar in size and risk. But, if you are about to carry out a new activity which is higher and/or uses a new piece of equipment such as adding Christmas lights to the roof, then you should carry out a new risk assessment for that.
- Pilla has a pre-built working at height risk assessment template which is explained below. This templates includes a list of things that you should think through, these are the common hazards associated with this type of risk. Depending on how your business operates, you may need to add extra items to the list on the template in order to cover all hazards in the risk assessment. 

 ## How to Structure Your Working at Height Risk Assessment

 A working at height risk assessment requires attention to safety because it involves tasks that are inherently hazardous if not managed properly. Whether you are replacing ceiling lights or accessing high storage, each activity brings unique challenges and risks. The more specific you can be in identifying and mitigating these risks, the safer the activity will be.

 In this article, I’ll guide you through:

 - Understanding the common hazards associated with working at heights
- Identifying who could be harmed and how
- Implementing controls and precautions to ensure safety
- Your legal responsibilities
- How to monitor and review the effectiveness of control measures

 By the end, you’ll have the tools needed to conduct a comprehensive working at height risk assessment and maintain a safe working environment.

 ## 1. List the Working at Height Tasks Being Assessed

 The first step is to identify and document each task that involves working at height in your establishment. This sets the scope for your risk assessment and ensures you address each unique risk associated with these tasks.

 Common tasks may include:

 - Replacing ceiling light bulbs
- Cleaning overhead vents
- Retrieving stock from high shelving

 Understanding specific tasks helps you tailor safety measures more accurately, ensuring that each procedure is compliant with safety regulations.

 **Why it matters:**

 Different tasks may pose varying levels of risk based on the height, tools needed, or the environment's layout. A task like bulb replacement may have different risks compared to accessing shelves in a storage area and so require different&nbsp; safety protocols. Defining and grouping tasks clearly ensures nothing is overlooked and makes sure that every task gets proper consideration.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A clear, concise list of each task that requires working at height
- Examples of where these tasks are generally performed within your venue
- An understanding of the frequency of these tasks to assess regularity and exposure

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Walk through your venue and note every task that involves reaching or climbing
- Consider routine maintenance, cleaning, restocking, and occasional events
- Think about the setup, teardown, or special operations that may not occur daily but still require attention

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “Just changing light bulbs” – Often, there are more tasks; don’t miss them (e.g., moving signs, dusting fixtures)
- Overlooking tasks that aren't frequent but still critical, like seasonal decorations

 ## 2. What Access Equipment Is Used?

 Once you’ve identified which tasks you're assessing, the next step is to document the access equipment used for these tasks. Ensuring the right equipment is available and suitable for the task is important.

 For working at height:

 - Use industrial standard ladders (BS EN131) at a minimum
- Avoid makeshift solutions like chairs or tables, which are unsafe
- Fix any defects before use. Do not use makeshift repairs

 **Why it matters:**

 Using inappropriate equipment is one of the leading causes of accidents in working at height scenarios. Non-industrial ladders can collapse, overloaded shelves can tip, and unstable platforms can lead to serious falls. Ensuring the correct equipment is used helps prevent these incidents.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A list of all access equipment used for working at height
- Verification of equipment standards compliance (e.g., BS EN131)
- Maintenance and inspection records indicating when the equipment was last checked or serviced
- Procedures for identifying and handling defective equipment

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Take stock of your current access equipment
- Confirm compliance with relevant safety standards
- Check for visible defects or signs of wear and damage
- Verify that staff are aware of the inspection procedures and know how to report defects

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - “A step-stool is fine for quick tasks” – Avoid non-standard equipment even for short tasks
- Ignoring regular inspections and maintenance routines
- Failing to replace equipment past its operational life

 ## 3. What Are You Already Doing to Control the Risks?

 Outline the existing safety measures you currently have in place for every task involving working at height. These measures aim to lessen the likelihood of incidents and accidents.

 Common control measures include:

 - Ensuring all equipment is visually checked before use
- Removing defective ladders from service immediately
- Ensuring staff receive training in the safe use of ladders
- Limiting work duration to under 30 minutes for reduced fatigue
- Conducting work outside of operating hours to minimise distractions
- Mandating three-point contact at all times

 **Why it matters:**

 Establishing a clear understanding of current measures helps identify gaps and areas requiring reinforcement or additional controls. By evaluating what's already in place, you set the foundation for targeted improvements.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A comprehensive list of control measures currently implemented
- Documentation on training procedures and routine checks
- Details of policies that limit risk, such as restricting over-reaching or work duration

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Review existing policies and procedures relating to working at height
- Discuss with staff to understand what measures are practically applied
- Gather records and feedback on what’s working and what’s not

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Relying on informal routines rather than documented procedures
- Assuming regular users know what to do but having no formal checks or training

 ## 4. Describe the Environment Where Working at Height Takes Place

 Assess the general environment where the working at height tasks occur. Consider factors that might influence safety, such as lighting, space for moving safely, surface texture, and the absence of obstructions.

 Include details about:

 - The adequacy of lighting and visibility
- The available space for safe use of ladders
- Floor surface quality (e.g., anti-slip mats)
- Potential trip hazards or obstructions

 **Why it matters:**

 The workspace conditions directly impact the safety of working at height. Poor lighting can obscure hazards, a cluttered area increases trips, and slippery surfaces can lead to falls. It’s vital to evaluate these conditions to ensure they don’t compromise the safety of the tasks performed.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A detailed description of the environment where each task takes place
- Identification of any hazards not sufficiently controlled by current measures
- Suggestions for eliminating or mitigating environmental hindrances

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Observe the actual workflows during these tasks to spot unforeseen hazards
- Engage with staff performing the tasks to gather their insight on challenges
- Document and update any changes needed to create a safer environment

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Overlooking environmental factors like lighting and floor surface in favour of focusing solely on the equipment
- Failing to maintain good housekeeping, which adds clutter to work areas

 ## 5. Is the Environment Suitable for Working at Height?

 In this section, confirm whether the environment is currently suitable for safely working at height. This determination should be based on your observations and analysis of existing conditions.

 Indicate with YES or NO whether the environment is suitable, and provide an explanation:

 **Why it matters:**

 It's essential to be honest and precise when concluding whether the current environment is adequate. If it's not, action is required to address any shortfalls contributing to unsafe working conditions.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Clearly stating whether the space is deemed suitable for working at height
- An explanation of the rationale behind your decision
- A call to action for any required modifications if the answer is “NO”

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Consider cross-referencing observed hazards with the control measures in place
- Evaluate surrounding conditions and how they impact the task
- Determine whether adjustments are necessary for improvement

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Saying “YES” without valid reasoning or evidence from either observations or records
- Failing to clarify your thought process in determining the environment’s suitability

 ## 6. What Further Actions Do You Need to Take to Reduce the Risks?

 Identify any additional actions required to mitigate risks associated with working at height that aren't effectively addressed by your current measures.

 Consider interventions such as:

 - Improving flooring grip or surface condition
- Enhancing lighting for better visibility
- Strengthening housekeeping protocols to maintain a clutter-free area
- Reinforcing staff training and ensuring clear documentation

 **Why it matters:**

 Safety risks evolve, and so must your control measures. A proactionary approach will substantially decrease incident likelihood and ensure continued compliance with health and safety regulations.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - A clear list of further actions to be implemented
- Designating responsible individuals or roles for implementing each measure
- Setting timelines or goals for action completion

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Review your current assessments and records to identify gaps or weaknesses
- Discuss improvements on procedures and environments with your team
- Set action points and follow through by assigning responsibility and monitoring results

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Believing no further actions are necessary without thorough review
- Lacking follow-up or assignment of responsibility to enact these changes

 ## 7. How Will You Monitor Your Controls?

 Detail how you intend to ensure that implemented controls remain effective and consistently followed.

 Your monitoring strategy might include:

 - Assigning specific individuals or teams to conduct inspections
- Setting a schedule for regular checks of both equipment and procedures
- Providing ongoing training refreshers for staff
- Encouraging feedback from those regularly involved in these tasks

 **Why it matters:**

 Monitoring maintains and enhances workplace safety conditions. With ongoing checks, you prevent complacency, react to new risks, and demonstrate compliance with health and safety regulations.

 **What good answers look like:**

 - Specific details regarding who will carry out inspections and checks
- The frequency with which these will occur
- A plan for enforcing compliance with updated training or procedures
- A system for recording findings and follow-through improvements

 **How to answer this for yourself:**

 - Develop a dedicated schedule indicating monitoring responsibilities and timelines
- Ensure documentation is clear and well-maintained
- Build flexibility into your plan to address and adapt to any issues when they arise

 **Common mistakes (and how to avoid them):**

 - Conducting initial assessments but failing to maintain ongoing checks
- Setting vague inspection guidelines without specific objectives
