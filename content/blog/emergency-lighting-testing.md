 Your hospitality team has a list of regular compliance activities which come as part of running a venue open to the public. One of those tasks which happens once a month is a test of the emergency lighting system. Emergency lighting is a backup lighting system that automatically turns on when the main power supply fails. It is designed to illuminate escape routes and emergency exits, making it easier for people to evacuate the building in an emergency such as a fire or power failure. Sometimes you may hear it called emergency escape lighting, escape route lighting or something similar. An emergency escape lighting system is a legal requirement in all commercial and public buildings, including hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and bars. 

 In the UK, emergency lighting is regulated by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which requires all non-domestic premises to have adequate and properly maintained emergency lighting systems.

 The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 requires that:

 - Emergency lighting systems must be installed where required.
- Emergency lighting systems must be regularly maintained and kept in good working order.
- Emergency lighting systems must be tested monthly, and the results must be recorded.

 Non-compliance with these legal requirements can result in enforcement action by the local fire authority, including fines and even imprisonment in serious cases.

 ## Monthly emergency lighting tests by staff.

 Your emergency lighting system must be tested by staff every month. The monthly test is a brief functional test that checks that all the emergency lights are working correctly and that the battery backup time is sufficient.
Because this is a staff task which needs to be carried out regularly, we have pre-built a template inside of Pilla so that staff can record each test.  Here are the steps to follow to carry out a monthly emergency lighting test:

 - Notify Occupants: Before starting the test, inform all building occupants that a test will be conducted and that they should not be alarmed by the sudden darkness.
- Isolate the Mains Power Supply: Locate the switch that controls the power supply to the emergency lighting system and turn it off to simulate a power outage.
- Observe the Emergency Lighting: Observe all the emergency lighting in the building or the area you are testing to ensure that all units illuminate as expected. Check that the brightness of the lights is sufficient to illuminate the escape routes and exits. You can walk through the building to check all emergency lighting is working correctly.
- Record the Results: Record the test results inside the Pilla app using the pre-built emergency lighting task.
- Restore the Mains Power Supply: Once the test is complete, restore the main power supply to the emergency lighting system. Make sure that the battery backup time is will last for the required duration of the test. Check the manufacturer's specifications for the expected backup time. The monthly test should only be functional and not discharge the batteries fully. Discharging the batteries fully during the monthly test can damage the battery, which could lead to a malfunction in the future.

 ## Emergency lighting maintenance.

 As well as the monthly emergency lighting testing carried out by your staff, you also need to arrange regular maintenance. Only properly maintained emergency lighting will be reliable in an emergency. 
The frequency of maintenance required depends on the type of emergency lighting system you have installed. For example, a self-contained emergency lighting system, where each emergency light or unit has its own battery and charger, may only require annual emergency lighting tests and maintenance. A centrally powered system, where a central battery and charger power all lights, will require more frequent maintenance. A competent person, such as a fire engineer or a qualified electrician, should maintain emergency lighting systems. During the maintenance visit, the electrician should check that all lights are working correctly, replace faulty bulbs, check the battery backup time, and ensure the system is operating correctly. This maintenance is often done at the time as fire alarm system maintenance which can save time and money if your contractor carries out both.&nbsp;

 Whenever maintenance happens, record it using the 'Maintenance' activity on the Pilla weekly planner. Make sure to select the correct recurring frequency if the maintenance will happen again so that you don't have to remember when it's due yourself.&nbsp;
