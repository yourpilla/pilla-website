title: How to safely reheat foods in your hospitality business.
tldr: >-
  - In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, food hygiene laws state that
  reheated foods must be reheated to temperatures to a minimum of 75°C.
  Reheating temperatures in Scotland differ under Scottish food hygiene laws
  reheated foods must reach a minimum temperature of 82°C. You should check the
  laws specific to your region.&nbsp;

  - Foods must be reheated to the correct temperatures to ensure that bacteria
  do not survive and that they have been reduced to a safe level for humans to
  eat. You should check the internal temperature of all reheated foods before
  before serving.

  - You should record information about a selection of reheating foods every day
  using the pre-built [Reheated Food Temperature Task
  Template](https://yourpilla.com/templates/cooked-food-temperature-check).
  Create five of these Reheated Food Tasks per day so you can record up to five
  examples of reheated foods. If you don't end up reheating five things on a
  given day, you should select 'Nothing Reheated' in the Task. The Task will
  record all of the required information including the food item, the food
  temperature, the date/time and the person who recorded the reheated food.

  - If anything goes wrong, highlight the issue using the using 'Issue' button
  and follow the corrective actions below. Record everything that you do as a
  post inside the reheated food temperature task so you are create a full
  digital paper-trail of compliance.
