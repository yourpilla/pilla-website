## Step 1: Describe Your Kitchen’s Style and Write an Introduction to Your Venue

 When crafting a job description for a Chef de Partie, starting with an introductory section about your restaurant aids potential applicants in aligning expectations with your requirements. This section can even be used for creating internal descriptions for existing staff. Instead of introducing them to the business, focus on reiterating the values or important aspects of your cuisine.

 **Your goal is to help the candidate quickly understand:**

- The nature of your establishment

- Your culinary approach and service style

- The experience of working in your kitchen

 Use this simple 3-part structure to begin:

 **1. What type of venue are you?**

 Provide a straightforward label: “We’re a fine dining restaurant / a bustling bistro / a farm-to-table café / a traditional pub offering modern twists…”

 **2. What’s your cooking style?**

 Illustrate your kitchen pace and customer experience. For example:

- “We serve exquisite plates focusing on seasonal ingredients with precise execution in a fast-paced environment.”

- “We offer a slow-cooked menu with an artisanal focus using locally sourced produce.”

- “We maintain a high-volume output, demanding exceptional organisational skills and rapid execution from our kitchen team.”

 **3. What sets your place apart?**

 Mention aspects like your team culture, setup, or overarching values. For example:

- “We embrace collaborative menu development and weekly tastings.”

- “Committed to sustainability, we follow farm-to-table practices.”

- “Our chefs engage in frequent workshops to enhance cooking techniques.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

 If you find yourself struggling with this section, ask:

- What does a routine day look like in your kitchen?

- How many courses do you typically serve each night?

- What level of customer interaction is common amongst kitchen staff?

- Do you prefer classical techniques or modern innovations in your cooking?

- What feedback do staff usually provide about working conditions or atmosphere?

 **Example 1: Lively bistro**

 We are a chic bistro in the heart of the city, serving a dynamic menu highlighting fresh, seasonal ingredients. Our team thrives in a high-paced environment, ensuring every plate is a balance of flavour and presentation. We value creativity and provide the freedom to explore it through our fortnightly specials.

 **Example 2: Farm-to-table eatery**

 We are a quaint café nestled in the countryside, advocating for earth-friendly practices with every meal crafted using local produce. Our chefs excel in creating wholesome dishes, with kitchen staff collaborating closely to deliver a warm, welcoming dining experience, extending from the kitchen to the table.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Chef de Partie

 Avoid vague task lists in job descriptions. Staying specific helps define the Chef de Partie’s role more effectively. Don't borrow or generalise — tailor it to fit your restaurant’s culinary needs.

 **Your goal is to outline tasks that represent your venue — not just any restaurant.**

 Draft up 6–10 bullet points discussing what is expected from a Chef de Partie on a day-to-day basis.

 Segment the role into three key stages of the day for clarity:

 **1. Preparation duties**

 These tasks occur before or at the beginning of service.

 Ask yourself:

- Who handles kitchen opening?

- What prep work is crucial before the service begins?

 Common tasks include:

- Preparing and mise en place for the day’s menu

- Ensuring all ingredients and tools are organised

- Assisting with stock rotation and inventory checks

- Reviewing the day's menu and specials with the head chef

 **2. Cooking responsibilities**

 The main duties occur during actual service hours.

 Ask yourself:

- Which part of the menu will the Chef de Partie oversee?

- What level of interaction is there with serving staff?

 Common tasks involve:

- Preparing dishes according to the restaurant's standards

- Coordinating with other station chefs for smooth service

- Maintaining hygiene standards throughout food preparation

- Providing support to junior station chefs when necessary

 **3. Closing and cleaning duties**

 These focus on the end-of-day wrap-up and maintenance routines.

 Ask yourself:

- Who handles station shutdown?

- What cleaning routines or safety checks are needed?

 Common tasks include:

- Cleaning down workstations and cooking tools

- Storing ingredients and leftovers correctly

- Participating in temperature and sanitation checks

- Collaborating on menu planning for upcoming shifts

 **If you’ve existing staff but lack a documented duty list, you can:**

- Observe Staff: Watch how your chefs handle prep, cooking, and post-service duties.

- Ask for Input: Request a breakdown of tasks from your current team to ensure comprehensive coverage.

- Consult Head Chef: Gain insights from the head chef or sous chef regarding key responsibilities and expectations.

 Useful dialogue starters with your Chef de Partie:

- “What are the main tasks you manage before, during, and after service?”

- “How do you ensure the quality and consistency of dishes served?”

- “How do you maintain kitchen safety and hygiene standards?”

- “What collaborative efforts are required with the entire kitchen team?”

- “What mentoring or support do you provide to new team members?”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Discuss with current kitchen staff about their experiences and daily routines.

- Review kitchen manuals or past training materials for specific insights.

- Reflect on past operational challenges to ensure they’re covered in duty descriptions.

 **Example for a mid-sized brasserie**

 As a Chef de Partie, you will be responsible for:

- Handling the mise en place and setup for daily menus.

- Ensuring exceptional quality in every dish during service.

- Coordinating with other kitchen team members to ensure efficient service periods.

- Guiding junior chefs in maintaining hygiene and speed standards.

- Participating in cleaning routines and preparing for the next shift’s menu needs.

 **Example for a fine-dining establishment**

 As a Chef de Partie, your role will encompass:

- Organising and conducting daily ingredient prep sessions.

- Crafting plates with precision and attention to detail.

- Synchronising closely with the sous chef to ensure order flow.

- Sharing insights and expertise with junior chefs, facilitating a learning environment.

- Overseeing end-of-day cleaning routines and reporting readiness for subsequent services.

## Step 3: Identify Required Skills for the Chef de Partie

 Your next step is to identify the skills necessary for the Chef de Partie to thrive in your restaurant’s unique setting. This helps candidates assess their fit and saves you from overlooking skilled individuals by keeping the focus relevant and tailored.

 **Your goal is to curate a mix of essential and desirable skills based on realistic expectations, not wishlist criteria.**

 **1. Revisit your responsibilities list**

 Review each responsibility and ask yourself:

 “What skill does someone need to effectively execute this task?”

 Examples:

- If they need to manage prep → they need expert organisational skills.

- Being the focal point between different stations → requires effective communication ability.

- Guaranteeing dish quality → necessitates a keen eye for texture and presentation.

 **2. Organise your list into two parts**

- Must-have skills - These are non-negotiable and crucial from day one.

- Bonus skills - These are additional and can be nurtured and acquired over time.

 **Potential skill areas to bear in mind:**

- Advanced knife skills and comfortable with different culinary techniques

- Experience with station organisation and kitchen equipment handling

- Food safety knowledge and hygiene practices

- Ability to work swiftly during high-volume periods

- Working as part of a culinary team

- Effective stock monitoring and ingredient ordering

 Only cover skills pertinent to your kitchen's operations.

 **Example for a creative cuisine-focused restaurant**

- Must-Have Skills

- In-depth knowledge of culinary techniques and flavoursCapability to adapt and integrate new recipes into the lineupExcellent teamwork and communication across kitchen stations

- In-depth knowledge of culinary techniques and flavours

- Capability to adapt and integrate new recipes into the lineup

- Excellent teamwork and communication across kitchen stations

- Bonus Skills

 **Example for a high-volume setting**

- Must-Have Skills

- Proven proficiency in high-pressure kitchen environmentsConfidence using a variety of kitchen tools and verifying food quality

- Proven proficiency in high-pressure kitchen environments

- Confidence using a variety of kitchen tools and verifying food quality

- Bonus Skills

- Ability to train and monitor kitchen assistantsFamiliarity with inventory systems and wastage reduction initiatives

- Ability to train and monitor kitchen assistants

- Familiarity with inventory systems and wastage reduction initiatives

 Outlining these skills ensures you appeal to candidates who match your expectations and can thrive in your culinary environment.

## Step 4: Defining the Experience Required

 An essential component of your job description involves detailing the desired level of experience. This reduces mismatched expectations and allows candidates to quickly understand their suitability for the role.

 However, overestimating experience requirements is a typical mistake. You may bypass capable candidates by setting undue prerequisites, particularly if you’re prepared to provide on-the-job development.

 **Your goal is to specify the experience necessary for this role – focusing on the type and environment rather than years alone.**

 **1. Determine whether this role is for a novice, intermediate, or advanced chef**

- Entry-level: You’re open to training a chef with minimal experience.

- Intermediate: You require a chef with practical experience in similar restaurant settings.

- Advanced: You’re looking for someone capable of leading a station autonomously, mentoring junior chefs and offering consistency daily.

 Be genuine about your needs, avoiding labelling the role as ‘advanced’ if basic reliability and skill are the main priorities.

 **2. Emphasise the environment over time**

 Instead of citing only “two years’ experience,” clarify the experience within specific settings. Reflect:

- Is prior experience in a fast-paced kitchen crucial?

- Must they be familiar with specific equipment or culinary styles?

- Do they need exposure to similar customer or service styles?

 Highlight specifics — someone with years at a fast food operation doesn’t align with six months in a rustic fine-dining atmosphere.

 **3. State whether training is available or negligible**

 Indicate if training or mentorship will be part of the role, or if a ready-to-go professional is paramount.

 **Example for an intermediate role**

 “We seek a candidate with a minimum of one-year kitchen experience in a high-standard restaurant. You should be comfortable managing a station actively and flexible in adapting to demands during service. We provide growth opportunities, but you should bring fundamental skills and composure from day one.”

 **Example for an entry-level role**

 “We offer training and seek someone with a keen interest in advancing their culinary skills. Professional experience isn’t mandatory but being passionate about cooking and work readiness is essential.”

 **Example for an advanced position**

 “A minimum of two years in demanding kitchen settings required, alongside proficiency in leading a team with clear communication. Expertise in high-quality dish preparation and fostering junior chef skill development is highly advantageous.”

## Step 5: Define the Personality and Cultural Fit Required

 While technical ability is critical, the essence of long-term success lies in cultural and personal fit. This section focuses on recruiting chefs who will mesh effectively with your kitchen’s ethos and dynamics.

 The hindrance is assembling phrases like “dedicated team player” which don’t convey anything tangible to potential candidates.

 Instead, clarify specific personality traits and behaviour traits that align with your kitchen environment.

 **Your goal is to articulate the attitudes, energy levels, and interaction styles conducive to excelling in your team.**

 **1. Reflect on your existing team dynamics**

 Consider the following:

- What shared traits do high-performing team members have?

- What characteristics have not thrived in past hires?

- Does your team maintain high energy and adaptability, or a more measured approach?

- Is customer interaction part of the chef’s responsibilities, and if so, what tone is desired?

 Craft a short list of keywords or descriptions summarising the energy and attitude desired.

 **2. Be definitive, not general**

 Avoid vague terms and instead illustrate this attribute in action:

- “Proactively manages mise en place to ensure seamless transition into service.”

- “Offers mentoring support to junior kitchen staff and helps foster skill growth.”

- “Directly engages with suppliers and resolves ingredient challenges creatively.”

 **3. Align personality attributes with role responsibilities**

- In intense, high-output environments: Look for calm demeanour under pressure with quick-thinking skills.

- In relaxed, customer-engaged restaurants: Seek warmth, observational skills, and a knack for conversation.

 **Example for a high-energy kitchen**

 “You’ll excel here if you thrive in dynamic environments, maintaining order and consistency during peak periods. We value a chef who coordinates their station efficiently, ensures timely service, and fosters a supportive atmosphere with their peers. An eagerness to innovate with seasonal ingredients is welcomed.”

 **Example for a sophisticated, relaxed bistro**

 “This position suits someone with an intuitive understanding of flavours and presentation, eager to collaborate and contribute constructively to menu creativity. The ability to engage with inquisitive diners and create warm relational experiences from kitchen to table is a significant asset.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Consult your current staff: “What qualities do you enjoy in your colleagues?”

- Revisit past hires — consider what characteristics proved ineffective.

- Be truthful. If your environment is bustling and demanding, express the need for composure and efficiency over creativity and spontaneity.

## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 This area often leaves candidates in ambiguity, yet it stands as one of the fundamental parts of a job description. Candidates need clarity on compensation and how their efforts are valued. Transparency in this step sets expectations, overturns misconceptions, and supports the engagement of committed professionals.

 While not always the leader in salaries, being forthcoming regarding benefits, perks, and work culture demonstrates accountability and fosters trust.

 **Be clear about:**

- The pay rate or range

- Additional benefits or perks

- What distinguishes your venue as a great workplace

 **1. Make pay clear — be it hourly, salaried, or otherwise**

 Specify the definite rate or present a realistic range. Guidance when unsure includes:

- Check offerings from similar establishments on platforms like Indeed, Eat Out, or regional culinary boards.

- Examine expectations — are you seeking junior, intermediate, or proficient chefs?

- Detail experiences if pay varies — but provide a range when possible.

 Example:

 £24,000–£28,000 annually based on experience

£13–£15/hour plus tips and performance bonuses Avoiding terms like “competitive pay” is critical as they are vague and generally unhelpful to candidates.

 **2. Highlight additional staff benefits**

 Benefits beyond salary can be a draw. Consider: 

- Complimentary or discounted meals

- Paid breaks or additional training

- Well-dispersed tip pools

- Regular social events with teammates

- Retirement options or healthcare benefits

- Predictable schedules or rota preferences

- Generous holiday offerings or policies

 Example:

- Complimentary meals during shifts

- Paid breaks and competitive holiday allocation

- Opportunities for further culinary training or certifications

- Shared tips and team-building activities

- Closed on public holidays and major festivities

 **3. Discuss development opportunities (if available)**

 Communicate offerings like structured mentorship or potential progression into higher roles.

 Example:

 We foster your potential through structured training, backing professional culinary certifications, and advancing within the team to senior roles as desired.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £25,000–£29,000 per annum depending on proficiency
Tips: Equitably split resulting in an average additional £2/hour

Benefits: 
- Free on-shift meals and drinks

- 30 days of paid holiday yearly

- Paid 45-minute breaks each shift

- Guidance for culinary certifications and contests

- Team dinners and industry expos

- No split shifts, primarily day or evening shifts

 **Tips if you’re stuck:**

- Reflect on reasons encouraging staff retention?

- Opt for honesty over inflated promises

- If pay is modest, accentuate other valuable work aspects (e.g., superior balance, supportive culture, continued education, rising career paths)
