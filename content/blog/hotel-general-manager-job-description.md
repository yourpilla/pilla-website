## Step 1: Define Your Hotel Environment
When writing a hotel general manager job description, start by clearly articulating your property's operational scope and strategic leadership requirements. The hotel general manager role varies dramatically between boutique inns, business hotels, and luxury resorts, so candidates must understand the specific management context they'll be entering.

The hotel general manager serves as the chief executive for the property, responsible for all operational departments, financial performance, and guest satisfaction. Without understanding your hotel's market position, service philosophy, and operational complexity, candidates can't assess whether their leadership experience matches your needs.

**Your goal is to help candidates understand:**

- Your hotel's market positioning and guest expectations
- The operational complexity and departmental coordination required
- The financial responsibilities and revenue management scope
- The leadership structure and team management demands

Use this 3-part approach:

**1. Define Your Hotel Type and Market Position**

Be specific about your property: "We operate a 120-room luxury business hotel in Manchester city centre / manage a 45-room boutique hotel with award-winning restaurant / run a 200-room conference hotel with extensive event facilities..."

Give candidates concrete details about your operational model:

- What's your ADR (Average Daily Rate) and occupancy targets?
- Do you focus on business travellers, leisure guests, or event bookings?
- Are you part of a hotel group or independent property?
- What's your average annual revenue and profit expectations?

**2. Describe Your Service Philosophy and Brand Standards**

Explain the leadership approach and service philosophy that drives your hotel. The general manager's role changes significantly based on brand expectations:

- "Our service philosophy emphasises personalised luxury experiences that exceed discerning guests' expectations whilst maintaining operational excellence."

- "We focus on efficient, professional service that delivers consistent value for business travellers whilst optimising revenue performance."

- "Our general manager leads a team delivering boutique hospitality that creates memorable experiences for leisure guests and local dining patrons."

- "We operate with luxury hotel standards that balance exceptional service with strong financial performance and brand compliance."

Detail the specific operational elements your general manager will oversee:

- How many rooms and what ancillary revenue streams do you manage?
- Do you operate restaurants, bars, spa, or conference facilities?
- Are there franchise standards or brand requirements to maintain?
- What makes your property unique in your competitive market?

**3. Highlight Your Leadership and Organisational Structure**

Showcase the executive leadership environment and departmental coordination:

- "Our general manager leads a team of 85 staff across front office, housekeeping, food & beverage, sales, and maintenance departments."

- "We operate with a flat management structure where the general manager works closely with department heads to deliver integrated guest experiences."

- "Our leadership approach emphasises developing senior staff whilst maintaining strict financial controls and operational standards."

- "The general manager coordinates between multiple revenue centres including rooms, restaurants, events, and ancillary services."

**Tips if you're unsure**

To get started, answer these questions comprehensively:

- How many rooms and what's your typical occupancy rate?
- How many departments does the general manager directly oversee?
- What's your annual revenue target and profit margin expectations?
- What's the complexity level of your operations and guest services?
- How does leadership information flow between departments and ownership?
- What makes your property challenging or unique compared to other hotels?
- Do you have specific brand standards or franchise requirements?
- How does your general manager interface with corporate or ownership structures?

**Additional considerations for your environment description:**

- Guest demographics: Are you serving corporate travellers, leisure tourists, or event attendees?
- Revenue streams: Do you focus on rooms revenue, F&B sales, or event bookings?
- Seasonal variation: Does operational complexity change with seasons or special events?
- Market position: Are you competing on luxury, value, or specialised services?
- Property age: Do you manage heritage buildings, new constructions, or renovation projects?

**Example 1: Luxury Business Hotel**

We operate a 150-room luxury business hotel in Edinburgh's financial district, generating £12 million annually through rooms, restaurant, and conference facilities. Our general manager oversees 95 staff across six departments, ensuring exceptional service for discerning corporate guests whilst maintaining 18% profit margins. The role demands sophisticated revenue management and the ability to coordinate seamlessly between front office, housekeeping, F&B, and event teams to deliver memorable experiences for high-expectation clientele.

**Example 2: Boutique Hotel with Restaurant**

We manage a 35-room boutique hotel with an award-winning restaurant serving both hotel guests and local diners. Our general manager leads a close-knit team of 28 staff, balancing intimate hospitality with business efficiency to achieve £3.2 million annual revenue. The environment is dynamic but controlled, requiring strong leadership skills to maintain service excellence across both accommodation and dining operations whilst building relationships with regular guests and local community.

**Example 3: Conference and Events Hotel**

We're a 180-room conference hotel specialising in corporate events, weddings, and training programmes alongside traditional accommodation. Our general manager coordinates between multiple revenue streams including rooms, restaurants, conference facilities, and catering operations whilst managing seasonal demand fluctuations. The role requires diplomatic leadership skills and operational expertise given our diverse guest mix and complex event coordination demands across our 12,000 square feet of meeting space.

## Step 2: Outline Key Responsibilities for the Hotel General Manager

The hotel general manager role encompasses strategic leadership, operational oversight, and financial management, but the specific duties vary significantly between properties. Focus on the actual executive tasks your general manager performs daily, from revenue optimisation to team development and guest experience management.

Avoid generic descriptions like "manage hotel operations" and create detailed responsibilities that reflect your property's specific operational demands and leadership structure.

**Your goal is to outline tasks that reflect your hotel's actual strategic and operational management needs.**

Write 10–15 bullet points covering the general manager's responsibilities throughout operations. Segment the role into three clear strategic areas:

**1. Strategic Leadership and Financial Management**

These responsibilities focus on executive oversight and business performance:

Consider who handles what in strategic leadership:

- Who sets revenue targets, pricing strategies, and budget management?
- How is financial performance monitored and reported?
- What strategic planning and market positioning decisions are required?

Common strategic leadership tasks include:

- Developing annual budgets, revenue forecasts, and profit targets in collaboration with ownership or corporate teams
- Implementing pricing strategies, yield management, and revenue optimisation across all hotel departments
- Analysing market trends, competitive positioning, and guest feedback to inform strategic decisions
- Managing relationships with corporate stakeholders, investors, and franchise partners
- Leading strategic planning sessions with department heads on operational improvements and guest experience enhancement
- Overseeing capital expenditure planning, renovation projects, and property maintenance investments
- Developing and monitoring key performance indicators for occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, and guest satisfaction
- Ensuring compliance with brand standards, franchise requirements, and regulatory obligations

**2. Operational Management and Guest Experience**

The core responsibilities for daily operations and service delivery:

Ask yourself what operational oversight your property demands:

- How complex is your departmental coordination and service integration?
- What level of guest experience management do you require?
- How do you handle operational challenges and service recovery?
- What quality assurance and standard maintenance is expected?

Essential operational management tasks include:

- Coordinating daily operations across front office, housekeeping, food & beverage, sales, and maintenance departments
- Ensuring consistent service delivery and guest satisfaction across all touchpoints and revenue centres
- Managing guest relations including VIP services, complaint resolution, and service recovery with discretion
- Overseeing food & beverage operations, restaurant management, and banquet coordination for events
- Coordinating with sales and marketing teams on group bookings, event management, and corporate accounts
- Implementing and maintaining quality assurance programmes across all departments and service standards
- Managing inventory control, procurement, and supplier relationships for optimal cost management
- Ensuring health and safety compliance, licensing requirements, and emergency procedure implementation

**3. Team Leadership and Human Resource Management**

Tasks that support staff development and organisational effectiveness:

Consider your team management requirements:

- What staff leadership and development duties need daily attention?
- How do you handle recruitment, training, and performance management?
- What coordination is needed between departments and shifts?

Executive team management responsibilities include:

- Recruiting, training, and developing department heads and senior management team members
- Conducting performance reviews, salary negotiations, and career development planning for senior staff
- Managing staffing levels, scheduling optimisation, and labour cost control across all departments
- Leading management team meetings, strategic planning sessions, and operational improvement initiatives
- Handling employee relations issues, disciplinary matters, and union negotiations where applicable
- Implementing training programmes, service standards, and professional development opportunities
- Coordinating with HR on recruitment strategies, compensation planning, and employee retention initiatives
- Building positive team culture, recognising achievements, and maintaining staff morale during challenging periods

**If you have a general manager but no documented duties, you can:**

- Shadow your current general manager: Observe their strategic decision-making, stakeholder communication, and crisis management throughout an entire week.
- Document their leadership style: Note specific approaches they use with department heads, guests, and corporate stakeholders during different operational scenarios.
- Consult your ownership or board: Understand expectations for financial performance, strategic planning, and operational excellence outcomes.
- Review performance reports: If available, analyse how leadership impacts key metrics during different business cycles and challenges.

Key questions to ask your current general manager might be:

- How do you prioritise competing strategic demands during budget planning periods?
- What leadership techniques work best with different department heads and their operational pressures?
- How do you handle escalated guest situations whilst maintaining property reputation?
- What systems do you use to monitor financial performance and operational efficiency?
- How do you coordinate with corporate stakeholders during strategic planning processes?
- What approaches do you take to develop senior staff and maintain service standards?
- How do you balance guest satisfaction with profit margin requirements?
- What methods do you use to maintain team morale and performance during difficult market conditions?

**Tips if you're unsure**

To develop comprehensive responsibility lists:

- Ask existing department heads to describe what they need from executive leadership during operations
- Use your financial reports and guest feedback to identify areas requiring strategic coordination
- Consider what breaks down when executive leadership is absent or ineffective
- Think about seasonal variations or market changes that affect general manager responsibilities
- Review operational challenges and successes to understand executive leadership impact

**Example for luxury business hotel**

As our hotel general manager, your responsibilities include:

- Leading strategic planning for 150-room property generating £12 million annually through rooms, F&B, and conference revenue
- Coordinating daily operations across six departments with 95 staff whilst maintaining 18% profit margins

- Overseeing guest experience delivery for discerning corporate clientele including VIP services and executive floor management

- Leading recruitment and development of department heads whilst maintaining luxury service standards
- Managing relationships with corporate clients, event planners, and franchise partners for business development
- Ensuring brand compliance, operational excellence, and regulatory adherence across all property operations

**Example for boutique hotel with restaurant**

- Manage integrated operations for 35-room property with award-winning restaurant generating £3.2 million annually

- Managing capital planning for meeting room technology, renovation projects, and facility improvements
- Ensuring health and safety compliance for large events whilst maintaining guest accommodation standards
- Leading performance management across multiple departments with focus on event execution and guest satisfaction

## Step 3: Specify Required Skills for the Hotel General Manager

A hotel general manager requires sophisticated executive leadership skills, comprehensive hospitality knowledge, and advanced business acumen. Focus on the specific capabilities your property demands rather than generic management requirements.

Building on responsibilities, identify the skills essential for effective hotel general manager performance. This ensures candidates can accurately assess their capability and development needs for your specific operational environment.

Focus on skills that match your property's executive demands and avoid generic lists. Each hotel requires different leadership approaches based on market position, operational complexity, and stakeholder expectations.

**Your goal is to create a list that separates essential executive skills from skills that enhance performance.**

**1. Review your task list**

Connect each responsibility with the skill needed to excel:

Example:

- If they develop annual budgets → they need financial analysis and strategic planning abilities
- If they manage stakeholder relationships → they need diplomatic communication and negotiation skills
- If they coordinate multiple departments → they need operational oversight and systems thinking
- If they handle crisis management → they need decisive leadership and problem-solving capabilities
- If they optimise revenue → they need commercial acumen and analytical thinking

**2. Divide your skills list**

- Essential Skills: Non-negotiable capabilities needed from day one
- Preferred Skills: Additional skills that enhance performance but can be developed

**Key Skill Areas for Hotel General Manager Roles**

Consider these fundamental skill categories:

- Strong executive leadership and strategic management capabilities
- Advanced financial management and commercial acumen
- Comprehensive hospitality operations and service expertise
- Excellent stakeholder communication and relationship management
- Strategic planning and business development competency
- Crisis management and problem-solving abilities
- Performance management and team development skills
- Revenue optimisation and market analysis understanding

Tailor this based on your hotel's exact requirements and operational complexity.

**Example for luxury business hotel**

Essential Skills:
- Proven executive leadership experience managing multi-department hotel operations with P&L responsibility
- Advanced financial management including budget development, revenue optimisation, and profit margin control
- Excellent stakeholder communication for corporate clients, ownership groups, and franchise relationships

- Excellent guest relations instincts with ability to create personalised experiences and build guest loyalty

- Technology proficiency including event management systems, catering software, and meeting room technology
- Project management skills for renovation, facility improvements, and operational change management
- Industry relationships with event planners, corporate travel departments, and meeting organisers

## Step 4: Determine Experience Requirements

The hotel general manager role demands specific executive leadership experience in hospitality operations. Be clear about whether you're seeking a seasoned executive ready to assume full strategic responsibility or someone with strong operational background who can grow into executive leadership with support.

Defining experience requirements helps candidates understand the executive expectations and prevents mismatched applications. However, overestimating requirements is a common mistake that can eliminate capable candidates with transferable leadership potential.

**Your goal is to specify the type of hospitality executive experience necessary, focusing on relevant operational environments rather than just years served.**

**1. Identify if the role suits a developing, experienced, or senior executive**

- Developing executive: Someone with strong department management experience ready to step into general manager role with training and support
- Experienced executive: Requires proven hotel general manager or equivalent executive experience in similar properties
- Senior executive: Looking for seasoned hospitality leader capable of transforming operational performance and mentoring management teams

Be honest about your needs; a developing property shouldn't demand senior-level experience if they can provide appropriate executive support and development.

**2. Specify the type of experience rather than just duration**

Instead of simply stating "5 years' management experience," outline important operational environments and capabilities:

- Do they need experience in luxury, business, or boutique hotel operations?
- Must they understand revenue management, multi-department coordination, or franchise systems?
- Is experience with event management, F&B operations, or corporate sales essential?
- Do they need experience with hotel chains, independent properties, or specific market segments?

Be precise — someone with 7 years managing chain properties differs significantly from 4 years in boutique luxury hotels.

**3. Indicate whether development and support will be provided**

If you're willing to invest in executive development, highlight it clearly. Conversely, if you need someone ready to lead strategically immediately, specify that expectation.

Consider what executive support you can realistically provide:

- Will you offer mentoring from senior ownership or experienced hotel executives?
- Do you have structured leadership development programmes or external executive training opportunities?
- Can you provide shadowing periods with successful general managers in similar properties?
- What timeline do you expect for full strategic competency and independent executive leadership?

**Example for experienced executive recruitment**

"We seek candidates with minimum 4 years' hotel general manager or equivalent executive experience in quality hospitality properties. You should demonstrate proven ability to manage P&L responsibility, lead multi-department teams, and coordinate complex revenue operations. Experience with revenue management, stakeholder relations, and strategic planning is essential. We provide ongoing support for professional development but expect immediate executive competency and strategic leadership."

**Example for developing executive opportunity**

"We're looking for ambitious hospitality professionals with 3+ years senior management experience ready to advance into general manager role. You should have solid operational background with department head experience and clear executive potential. Comprehensive general manager training will be provided alongside ownership mentorship, with structured development over 12 months including executive coaching and hospitality leadership education support."

**Example for senior executive role**

"Candidates should bring minimum 7 years' hotel general manager or senior hospitality executive experience in upscale or luxury properties. You must demonstrate exceptional leadership abilities, strategic acumen, and proven track record of operational improvement and profit optimisation. Experience with multi-department coordination, stakeholder management, and revenue growth is essential for immediate strategic impact and property transformation."

**Example for boutique hotel executive**

"We require candidates with hospitality executive experience including boutique hotels, independent properties, or small luxury operations. Previous experience managing intimate properties, local market development, and hands-on operational involvement is essential. Understanding of independent hotel challenges, community relationships, and personalised service delivery necessary. Minimum 4 years in similar executive capacity with P&L responsibility required."

## Step 5: Describe the Ideal Personality Fit

The hotel general manager role demands specific personality traits for successful executive leadership and stakeholder management. This position requires someone who can command strategic authority whilst inspiring teams and delivering exceptional financial performance.

While technical skills matter, long-term success depends on cultural fit and executive leadership personality. This section helps you attract candidates whose natural traits align with your hotel's operational philosophy and stakeholder expectations.

Avoid generic phrases like "natural leader" or "people person" which don't convey meaningful information to potential executives.

Instead, describe specific personality traits and behavioral characteristics that succeed in your hotel environment.

**Your goal is to articulate the leadership style, executive presence, and interpersonal skills that thrive in your operational culture.**

**1. Reflect on your operational culture and stakeholder dynamics**

Consider the following:

- What executive traits do your most successful leaders demonstrate?
- What personality characteristics have struggled in previous executive hires?
- Does your property thrive with authoritative leadership or collaborative approaches?
- Are stakeholder interactions formal and strategic or relationship-based and personal?
- What leadership communication style works best with your ownership and teams?
- Do you need someone diplomatic and measured or dynamic and decisive?
- How does your hotel handle pressure and operational challenges?
- What personality traits help during financial pressures and market difficulties?

Develop keywords that capture the executive presence and approach desired.

**2. Be definitive, not general**

Avoid vague terms and instead illustrate traits in action:

- "Maintains composed executive leadership during crisis situations whilst inspiring team confidence and stakeholder trust"
- "Demonstrates natural diplomacy when managing complex stakeholder relationships and sensitive operational situations"
- "Adapts leadership style to motivate diverse management teams whilst maintaining consistent performance standards"
- "Shows genuine passion for hospitality excellence that inspires both staff and guest satisfaction outcomes"
- "Exhibits strategic thinking and commercial acumen when balancing service quality with profit requirements"

**3. Align personality attributes with executive responsibilities**

- In luxury, upscale environments: Look for sophisticated authority combined with attention to detail and grace under pressure
- In business hotels or chain operations: Seek efficiency and systematic thinking balanced with relationship management capability
- In boutique or independent settings: Value creativity and personal engagement balanced with commercial discipline and strategic thinking

**Example for luxury business hotel**

"You'll excel as our hotel general manager if you possess natural executive presence and composure combined with genuine passion for luxury hospitality excellence. We value leaders who command respect through expertise and strategic thinking rather than authority alone, inspiring management teams to deliver exceptional results whilst maintaining the sophisticated atmosphere our guests expect. The ability to read complex stakeholder situations, anticipate market changes, and handle sensitive guest and ownership relations with discretion is essential."

**Example for boutique independent hotel**

"This role suits someone with entrepreneurial leadership who genuinely enjoys creating unique experiences for guests whilst developing strong local relationships. We value authentic hospitality executives who balance creative vision with commercial discipline, ensuring our independent property feels distinctive whilst achieving sustainable profit performance. Strong emotional intelligence, adaptability, and ability to maintain positive energy during market challenges whilst building community connections are crucial."

**Example for conference and events hotel**

"Our ideal hotel general manager demonstrates sophisticated operational intelligence combined with diplomatic leadership skills appropriate for complex event coordination. You should possess commercial awareness and project management instincts suitable for managing multiple revenue streams whilst maintaining approachable professionalism that puts clients at ease. Natural organisation skills, attention to detail, and ability to coordinate diverse teams whilst representing our brand with distinction are essential qualities."

**Tips if you're stuck**

- Consult current management team: "What executive qualities do you most respect and respond to?"
- Observe successful hotel leaders during different situations and pressure levels
- Consider what guest and stakeholder feedback reveals about preferred leadership and communication styles
- Ask your team what personality traits create the best operational environment
- Reflect on previous executives - what leadership personalities succeeded or struggled?
- Be authentic about your environment - if it's demanding and results-focused, seek disciplined and strategic leaders rather than purely relationship-oriented types
- Consider cultural fit with your market position and stakeholder expectations

## Step 6: Provide Transparency on Compensation

Transparency about compensation is crucial for attracting quality hotel general manager candidates. This senior executive role commands significant salary and benefits, so be clear about your total compensation package and strategic leadership development opportunities.

This section often receives inadequate attention, yet it's fundamental to attracting committed hospitality executives. Candidates need clarity on compensation and career advancement to make informed decisions about executive opportunities.

While you may not lead the market in salary, transparency about benefits, development opportunities, and working conditions demonstrates professionalism and builds trust with potential leaders.

**Be clear about:**

- The salary range or total compensation package
- Executive benefits and professional development opportunities  
- What distinguishes your hotel as an exceptional place to lead and develop strategically

**1. Make compensation clear — salary and benefits**

Specify the definite salary or present a realistic range. Guidance when unsure includes:

- Research similar hotel general manager positions in your area using hospitality recruitment consultants and industry contacts
- Consider your expectations — are you seeking developing, experienced, or senior executive leadership?
- Factor in the complexity and responsibility level of your specific general manager role
- Include performance bonuses, profit sharing, or equity participation if applicable

Example:
£65,000–£85,000 annually based on experience plus performance bonuses
£75,000 starting salary with quarterly reviews and merit increases
£80,000 base salary plus 3% of annual profit exceeding budget targets

Avoiding terms like "competitive salary" is essential as they provide no useful information to candidates.

- Executive development funding for hospitality qualifications and strategic management training

- Profit sharing, performance bonuses, or equity participation programmes
- Comprehensive executive healthcare, pension, and family support benefits
- Industry networking opportunities, conference attendance, and professional recognition

- Comprehensive executive healthcare including private medical, dental, and family coverage
- 35 days paid holiday plus bank holidays and professional development time

**3. Discuss career progression and development (if available)**
