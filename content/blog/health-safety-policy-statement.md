 In the UK the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 states that every employer must so far as is reasonably practicable ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees and others who may be affected by their business. Under this legislation employers must establish and maintain a health and safety policy which includes a written statement of their approach to managing health and safety. This statement is often referred to as the “Health and Safety Policy Statement” and is a formal commitment from the employer to health and safety and outlines the responsibilities of management and employees to a safe working environment. The law requires this statement to be brought to the attention of all employees, reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to reflect changes in the business or legislation. This document is the foundation of a safety culture in the workplace and compliance with the law.

 In the U.S. the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act 1970 is overseen by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Similar to the UK’s Health and Safety at Work Act, the OSH Act requires employers to provide a workplace that is “free from recognised hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees.

 Under OSHA guidelines it’s recommended but not mandatory for U.S. businesses to have a written safety and health policy. OSHA does however provide guidance that encourages employers to put in writing specific safety responsibilities, management commitments and safety procedures similar to the structure found in UK policy statements. Many U.S. businesses choose to have written safety policies for compliance and a clear safety culture, just like what’s expected in UK legislation.
