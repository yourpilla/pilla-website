 ## Step 1: Start with Your Hotel Overview

 Begin your job description with an overview that encapsulates your hotel’s identity, market, and values. This helps potential candidates quickly understand the setting and specific dynamics of your venue.

 **Your goal is to convey:**

- The type of hotel you operate

- Your unique market and positioning

- What makes your hotel an attractive workplace

 Follow this easy 3-part approach:

 **1. What sort of hotel are you?**

 Provide a clear definition: “We are a luxury city hotel / a high-traffic airport hotel / a charming boutique inn...“

 **2. What’s the market you serve?**

 Articulate your market and guest expectations.

- “We primarily cater to business travellers and conferences."

- “Our major clientele consists of tourists seeking cultural experiences."

- “We serve a diverse group, including leisure, family, and business guests."

 **3. What is distinctive about working at your location?**

- "We encourage innovation and provide ongoing professional development programs."

- "Our team is collaborative and highly values employee input."

- "We offer flexible scheduling and a beneficial work-life balance."

 **Advice if you're stuck:**

- Think about your typical guests and their needs.

- Consider what type of revenue management style best fits your market.

- Reflect on what staff often appreciate about working at your hotel.

 **Example 1: Large Chain Hotel**

 We are a bustling 300-room hotel centrally located, catering primarily to business travellers. Our team thrives on efficiency and collaboration, with a strong focus on utilising data-driven strategies to enhance guest experience and maximize profitability.

 **Example 2: Boutique Hotel**

 Located in the heart of the historic district, our boutique hotel offers personalised experiences to leisure travellers. We pride ourselves on attention to detail and superior guest service, providing a different perspective in hotel management.

 ## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Hotel Revenue Manager

 When outlining the Revenue Manager’s duties, specificity is crucial. A copied or vague list helps no one. Tailor the responsibilities to the unique challenges and routines of your hotel.

 **Your goal is to list tasks reflecting the actual day-to-day of your venue.**

 Here’s a suggested breakdown into daily, weekly, and monthly tasks:

 **1. Day-to-day responsibilities**

- Monitor daily pick-up reports and analyse booking patterns.

- Adjust rates and inventory based on market demand.

- Communicate with the sales team about upcoming events and adjustments.

 **2. Weekly responsibilities**

- Conduct weekly revenue meetings with relevant staff.

- Review competitor pricing and positioning.

- Update distribution channels and third-party sites.

 **3. Monthly responsibilities**

- Analyse monthly performance metrics and KPIs.

- Prepare forecasts, budgets and identify potential areas for growth.

- Evaluate the success of executed strategies and adjust accordingly.

 **If you need help identifying responsibilities:**

- Consult your current team about what they do day-to-day.

- Review past job descriptions or documentation.

- Consider what tasks are crucial for success in your revenue operations.

 >>> Self-Assessment Questions for Your Venue:
>>> - What are the three most important outcomes you expect from your Revenue Manager?
>>> - What does a successful week or month look like for revenue management?
>>> - What are the biggest challenges your Revenue Manager will face?
>>> TIP: If you’re unsure, shadow your current Revenue Manager for a week or ask them to list their top 10 recurring tasks.

 **Example for a large hotel chain**

 Your duties will include monitoring room availability and adjusting rates, hosting weekly revenue assessments with department heads, and reporting directly to the revenue director to develop cutting-edge pricing strategies.

 **Example for a boutique hotel**

 Your responsibilities will involve managing room inventory with precision, analysing competition, and collaborating with marketing for promotions catered to our distinctive offerings.

 ## Step 3: Define the Necessary Skills

 After listing out responsibilities, it’s time to identify the skills needed to execute those tasks proficiently. Your objective is to avoid generic skill lists, focusing instead on competencies required by the role.

 **Your goal is to develop a relevant list of required skills based on actual demands.**

 Start with skills directly related to day-to-day tasks:

- Proficiency with revenue management software (e.g., RevPAR, STR)

- Strong analytical and financial forecasting skills

- Understanding of distribution channels and OTA management

- Excellent communication and leadership abilities

- Flexibility in adapting strategies to dynamic market conditions

 Then split them into:

- **Must-have skills**: Essential for success from day one

- **Nice-to-have skills**: Helpful but can be developed further

 **Example for a city hotel**

 **Must-Have Skills**

- Experience with revenue software and strong data analysis acumen

- Communication skills to convey complex concepts to team members

- Understanding of local market trends and competitor strategies

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Experience in hotel marketing strategies

- Knowledge of other European markets

 **Example for a resort hotel**

 **Must-Have Skills**

- Experience maximising resort occupancy and seasonal pricing

- Strategic thinking with a strong focus on guest satisfaction

- Capability to analyse diverse guest segments

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Fluency in other languages

- Familiarity with luxury market positioning

 ## Step 4: Specify Required Experience Level

 Next, be clear what kind of experience candidates need. This prevents attracting unsuitable applicants and ensures candidates know what’s expected.

 **Aim to clarify the type and level of experience truly required for the job.**

 Decide if the role is:

- **Entry-level:** suitable for candidates with a solid educational background and some hotel experience.

- **Mid-level:** requiring proven revenue management experience in a similar environment.

- **Senior:** expecting leadership skills and significant strategic input.

 >>> Clearly state the type and amount of experience needed for the role. Avoid vague requirements like “5+ years’ experience.” Instead, specify:
>>> - The type of hotels or markets (e.g., city, resort, multi-property)
>>> - The scale of revenue managed
>>> - Any required certifications or systems expertise
>>> Example:
>>> “We’re seeking a Revenue Manager with at least 3 years’ experience in a high-volume hotel, proven success in dynamic pricing, and a track record of driving RevPAR growth.”
>>> Self-Assessment Questions for Experience:
>>> - Has the candidate managed revenue for a property of similar size and market?
>>> - Have they worked with the same or similar revenue management systems?
>>> - Can they provide examples of successful pricing or distribution strategies?

 **Example for a mid-level role**

 "This position requires at least 2 years of revenue experience in a competitive hotel market. Familiarity with strategic pricing and working knowledge of Yield Management Software is crucial."

 **Example for a senior role**

 "Minimum of 5 years in a senior revenue management role creating strategies across multiple distribution channels. Strong leadership to influence hotel revenue direction and provide mentoring support to junior analysts."

 ## Step 5: Define Necessary Personality Traits and Cultural Fit

 It’s important to think about soft skills and personality when hiring. Technical skills don’t suffice if someone doesn’t fit the team’s culture. State clearly the personal traits you value for this role.

 **Your goal is to describe the attitudes and qualities that mesh well with your team’s dynamic.**

 Determine your expectations:

- How does your team collaborate during busy times?

- What personal qualities contribute to success in your environment?

- Would you prefer an analytical thinker or a creative problem-solver?

 **Give specific examples:**

- "Collaborative mindset with a willingness to provide and receive feedback."

- "Analytical and detail-oriented, with the ability to see the big picture."

- "Proven ability to work independently yet remain approachable and open-minded."

 >>> Go beyond generic terms like “analytical thinker.” Instead, describe the specific attitudes and behaviours that thrive in your revenue team.
>>> Example:
>>> “The ideal candidate is detail-oriented, proactive, and thrives under pressure. They value open feedback, foster a collaborative environment, and are passionate about using data to drive results.”
>>> TIP: Ask your team, “What makes a great revenue manager here?” and include their answers.

 **Example for a fast-moving environment**

 "You’ll succeed one who’s adaptable, thrives under tight deadlines, and remains meticulous with details. Our team appreciates proactive thinkers who bring innovative solutions to the table and engage openly across hotel departments."

 **Example for a relaxed boutique atmosphere**

 "This role suits someone who is communicative, personable and enjoys a slower-paced, customer-driven environment. Being supportive and attentive to both guests' and staff's needs is key in creating the warm, welcoming atmosphere we treasure."

 ## Step 6: Define Compensation and Benefits

 Lastly, discuss pay and benefits to offer transparency, which helps filter candidates who meet your expectations. Disclose salary ranges to show you're open and up-to-date with market standards.

 **Indicate:**

- The salary or salary range

- Any included bonuses or incentive schemes

- Add-ons like perks, professional development or work environment bonuses

 **1. Specify the salary type**. Whether it's salaried, includes commission or offers incentive schemes. If uncertain, check what similar roles are offering via LinkedIn or industry sites.

 Example:

- £35,000 - £45,000 plus performance-related bonuses

- Competitive salary with potential for annual performance reviews

 **2. List staff benefits**, tangible and intangible:

- Healthcare and pension schemes

- Discounted or comped hotel stays, if relevant

- Flexible scheduling or remote working options

- Paid conferences or continuous learning support

 Example:

- Free hotel stays for family and friends

- Professional development funding

- Pension contribution after three months

- Corporate health plan and wellbeing programme

 **3. Discuss opportunities for professional growth (if relevant)**. Clarify prospects such as skills enhancement workshops, certifications or career progression pathways.

 Example: "We support your career progression with access to industry conferences, in-house training, and a clear path to senior management roles for committed team members."

 >>> Clearly state the salary range, bonus structure, and any unique benefits (e.g., profit sharing, training budget, flexible schedule, staff meals, or industry conference attendance).
>>> Example:
>>> “Salary: £45,000–£60,000 per year, plus annual performance bonus, private health insurance, and annual revenue management conference attendance.”
>>> TIP: If your salary is below market, highlight other benefits or growth opportunities.

 **Example section: Compensation &amp; Benefits**

 Salary: £35,000–£50,000 per annum with performance-related bonuses
Benefits: 
- Private healthcare and pension contributions

- Complimentary hotel stays and discounts

- Paid training programmes

- Flexible hours and possibility for remote work

 **Tips if you're stuck:**

- Ask yourself: What makes this role rewarding beyond the paycheck?

- Be realistic and straightforward — an informed candidate is often more committed.

- If salary is on the modest side, highlight unique benefits or culture.
