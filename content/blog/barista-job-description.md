## Step 1: Start with the Service Style and Write an Introduction to Your Business

 If you are writing a job description for a new hire, then including a section at the top to describe your business is important to help potential candidates understand what they are applying for. But this section can also be used if you are writing a new job description for a current employee. Obviously you won't need to describe many of the same things, but you can use it as a space to remind the candidate about the most important things in your business.

 **Your goal is to help the candidate quickly understand:**

- What kind of place you are

- What kind of coffee service you offer

- What working in your venue feels like

 Use this simple 3-part structure to get started:

 **1. What type of venue are you?**

 Start with a clear label: “We’re an independent café / a fast-paced coffee kiosk / a hotel coffee bar / a brunch spot with a focus on speciality coffee…”

 **2. What’s your service style?**

 Describe the pace and customer experience. For example:

- “We serve 300+ coffees a day with quick, friendly service to takeaway customers.”

- “We’re slower-paced, with full table service and a focus on hospitality.”

- “We’re a high-volume venue with a big team and fast turnover.”

 **3. What makes your place different or appealing to work at?**

 This could be your team culture, your setup, or your values. For example:

- “We’re a small, close-knit team where everyone helps each other.”

- “We rotate seasonal beans from local roasters.”

- “Our baristas take part in regular cuppings and menu tastings.”

- “We’re committed to reducing waste and using sustainable practices.”

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

 If you're not sure what to write, answer these questions out loud first:

- What’s a typical day like in your café?

- How many coffees do you usually make a day?

- Do customers order at the counter or get table service?

- What’s the vibe of your team — fast and focused or relaxed and chatty?

- Do you use manual or automatic machines?

- What do staff usually say they enjoy about working here?

 You’re not trying to impress anyone — just describe what it’s really like.

 **Example 1: Fast-paced coffee bar**

 We’re a busy espresso bar in the city centre, serving over 400 coffees a day to commuters and office workers. Our team works fast, keeps the vibe friendly, and takes pride in consistency and speed. We use a La Marzocco Linea PB and dial in every morning with a seasonal blend from Origin.

 **Example 2: Sit-down café with table service**

 We’re a laid-back neighbourhood café serving brunch and single-origin espresso with full table service. Our team is small and collaborative — baristas and FOH staff work closely to deliver a calm, welcoming experience for regular customers. We rotate beans monthly and offer pour-over alongside espresso.

## Step 2: Define Key Responsibilities for the Barista

 Too many job descriptions are vague here. They either use generic phrases like “prepare coffee” or they copy lists from other businesses that don’t match their own service style.&nbsp;

 **Your goal is to create a list that reflects your venue — not someone else’s.**

 Write 6–10 bullet points describing what your barista will be responsible for in your business — not just in theory, but in day-to-day reality.

 Break the role into three daily phases. This makes it easier to write and helps you think through the full shift:

 **1. Opening and prep responsibilities**

 These are the tasks done before or at the start of service.

 Ask yourself:

- Who opens the coffee station?

- What needs to be set up or checked?

 Common examples:

- Dial in grinders and espresso machine at the start of shift

- Restock milk, cups, takeaway lids, and cleaning materials

- Prepare batch brew or filters for the day

- Clean and sanitise work surfaces and equipment before service

 **2. Service responsibilities**

 These are the core tasks done during trading hours.

 Ask yourself:

- Does the barista interact with customers?

- Are they making coffee only, or also taking orders?

- Do they serve food or just drinks?

 Common examples:

- Prepare espresso-based and filter drinks to a consistent standard

- Take customer orders and operate the till (if required)

- Maintain speed and quality during busy periods

- Communicate with front-of-house to manage wait times and orders

- Keep workstation clean and well-stocked throughout service

 **3. Cleaning and closing responsibilities**

 These are the end-of-shift tasks or cleaning routines.

 Ask yourself:

- Who is responsible for closing the barista station?

- What cleaning tasks are expected?

 Common examples:

- Clean and backflush espresso machine and grinders

- Restock the station for the next day

- Wash and sanitise jugs, tools, and work surfaces

- Complete daily cleaning and waste disposal tasks

 **If you already have Baristas but haven't documented their duties, you can:**

- Observe Them on Shift**:**&nbsp;Watch how they manage drink preparation, customer interactions, and downtime tasks

- Request Their Input:&nbsp;Ask for a list of their daily responsibilities to capture everything they manage

- Consult Supervisors:&nbsp;Speak with shift leads or managers for additional insights

 Useful questions to ask your Baristas:

- What are your key responsibilities before, during, and after each shift?

- How do you maintain beverage quality and consistency?

- What steps do you take to care for and maintain equipment?

- How do you collaborate with the kitchen and front-of-house teams?

- What training or mentorship do you provide for newer staff?

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask a current staff member to talk through a typical shift

- Look at your rotas or opening checklists for inspiration

- Think about what goes wrong when this role is done badly — then make sure it’s listed clearly here

 **Example for a small, sit-down café**

 As a barista, your responsibilities will include:

- Dialling in and preparing the coffee station for morning service

- Making espresso and filter drinks to a consistent, high standard

- Working closely with FOH to manage drinks orders during busy periods

- Engaging with customers and answering basic questions about our coffee

- Cleaning down and restocking the station at the end of each shift

 **Example for a fast-paced takeaway bar**

 As a barista, your responsibilities will include:

- Preparing espresso drinks quickly and accurately in high-volume service

- Keeping the bar clean and stocked with milk, cups, and consumables

- Managing dial-in and ensuring quality across multiple team members

- Taking customer orders and using the till when required

- Carrying out daily cleaning and maintenance of machines and tools

## Step 3: Define What Skills the Person Will Need to Have

 Now that you’ve outlined the responsibilities, it’s time to define the skills the barista needs to succeed in your venue.

 This section helps applicants self-assess and prevents you from wasting time on candidates who aren’t a good fit. But just like with responsibilities, avoid copying a generic list. Focus only on the skills that are relevant to how your venue runs.

 **Your goal is to to create a list of essential and preferred skills based on your actual expectations - not wishful thinking.**

 **1. Look back at your responsibilities list**

 Go through each task and ask:

 “What skill does someone need to do this well?”

 Example:

- If they need to dial in a grinder → they need basic espresso calibration skills

- If they’re talking to regulars → they need strong customer communication

- If they’re restocking and prepping solo → they need good time management

 **2. Split your list into two parts**

- Must-have skills

 These are non-negotiable. The person needs to walk in with these on day one.

- Nice-to-have skills

 These are a bonus — great if they have them, but not required. You can train or develop them over time.

 **Common skill areas to consider**

- Espresso knowledge (dialling in, adjusting grind, dose, yield)

- Milk steaming and basic latte art

- Coffee consistency and speed during busy service

- Customer service and communication

- POS or till use

- Hygiene and cleanliness standards

- Teamwork and communication during service

- Time management and prep efficiency

 Only include what applies to your setup.

 **Example for a quality-focused café**

 Must-Have Skills

- Experience making espresso drinks using a manual machine

- Able to steam milk with good texture and produce basic latte art

- Understands coffee dosing, yield, and grinder adjustment

- Comfortable communicating with customers in a relaxed service style

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Knowledge of single-origin coffee or different brew methods

- Familiarity with daily dial-in and espresso calibration

- Interest in cuppings or tasting sessions

 **Example for a fast-paced takeaway bar**

 Must-Have Skills

- Able to make consistent coffee quickly under pressure

- Comfortable using automatic or semi-automatic machines

- Strong customer service in a fast-moving queue

- Good hygiene and clean-as-you-go habits

 **Nice-to-Have Skills**

- Previous experience in a high-volume coffee environment

- Ability to multi-task across drinks, till, and prep

- Familiarity with stock rotation and daily restocking

 With the duties outlined, you can now define the specific skills and experience required to perform each task at a high standard. This ensures your job description attracts the right candidates for your café environment.

## Step 4: Defining How Much Experience Is Required

 Once you’ve listed the skills, you need to clarify how much real-world experience the candidate should have. This helps avoid mismatched expectations and lets candidates quickly assess whether they’re a good fit.

 But be careful because asking for more experience than the job really needs is one of the most common hiring mistakes. You could put off great candidates who are perfectly capable — especially if you’re willing to train them.

 **Your goal is to be specific about what kind of experience the role requires — not just how many years, but what kind of environment the person needs to be familiar with.**

 **1. Decide if this is a trainee, experienced, or senior role**

- Entry-level: You’re happy to train someone with no real coffee experience.

- Mid-level: You need someone with solid, hands-on experience in a similar café or bar.

- Senior: You need someone who can lead a station, train others, or take ownership of consistency.

 Be honest about what you actually need. Don’t label the role “senior” just because you want someone reliable — that’s a recipe for underpaying and overworking someone.

 **2. Focus on the type of experience, not just the time**

 Instead of just writing “2 years’ experience,” explain the environment. Ask yourself:

- Do they need experience in a fast-paced, high-volume setting?

- Do they need experience using manual espresso machines and adjusting grinders?

- Do they need to have worked in a similar customer interaction style (counter service, table service, etc)?

 Be precise — someone with 3 years at a petrol station coffee machine doesn’t equal someone with 6 months on a La Marzocco in a specialty café.

 **3. Say whether training is offered or expected**

 If you’re happy to train, say so. If you need someone ready to jump behind the machine from day one, say that instead.

 **Example for a mid-level barista**

 "We’re looking for someone with at least 6 months of hands-on barista experience in a café environment. You should be comfortable using a manual espresso machine, steaming milk, and preparing drinks to order during busy service. We’ll support your development, but you’ll need to hit the ground running on the coffee bar."

 **Example for a trainee-friendly venue**

 "No professional experience is required — but you’ll need to show a genuine interest in coffee and be willing to learn quickly. We provide full training on our machines, drinks menu, and service style."

 **Example for a senior role**

 "You’ll need a minimum of 1 year’s experience in a high-quality coffee venue, with confidence dialling in espresso, leading a barista station, and maintaining consistency. Experience training junior baristas or running opening/closing shifts is a big plus."

## Step 5: Define What Personality and Cultural Fit Is Required

 Hiring for skills is important but hiring for personality is what makes someone a great long-term fit. This section of the job description helps you attract people who’ll actually enjoy working in your team and thrive in your environment.

 But here’s the mistake most people make - they write something generic like “hard-working team player” or “friendly and reliable.” That tells the candidate nothing useful.

 Instead, describe the actual personality traits and behaviours that succeed in your café.

 **Your goal is to clearly describe the kind of attitude, energy, and communication style that fits your team and venue.**

 **1. Think about what’s already working on your team**

 Ask yourself:

- What do your best team members have in common?

- What kind of personalities struggle in your venue?

- Is your team energetic and fast-paced, or calm and focused?

- Is customer interaction warm and chatty — or more quick and professional?

 Write down a few key words or phrases that describe the energy you want behind the bar.

 **2. Be specific, not vague**

 Don’t just say “team player” — say what that looks like in action. For example:

- “Jumps in to help with restocking when it’s busy”

- “Communicates clearly during a fast-paced rush”

- “Welcomes regulars and remembers their orders”

 **3. Match the personality to the role’s pressure level**

- If your café is high-volume and intense: you need someone calm under pressure and able to prioritise.

- If your venue is slower-paced and customer-focused: you need someone warm, observant, and happy to chat.

 **Example for a fast-paced takeaway café**

 "You’ll thrive in this role if you’re calm under pressure, quick on your feet, and focused on consistency. Our baristas work closely as a team, especially during peak hours, so clear communication and a can-do attitude are essential. We’re looking for someone who enjoys working quickly and helping things run smoothly."

 **Example for a sit-down brunch venue**

 "This role suits someone who’s friendly, observant, and confident interacting with customers. We’re a small, tight-knit team, so we value people who take pride in their work, support their teammates, and bring a positive energy to each shift. A genuine interest in coffee and hospitality is a big plus."

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask your current staff: “What kind of people do you love working with?”

- Think back to previous hires who didn’t work out — what was missing?

- Keep it honest. If your venue is chaotic, say you need someone who stays calm and focused — not someone who “thrives on creativity and variety.”

## Step 6: Define the Pay and Benefits

 This is where many hospitality businesses go silent but it’s one of the most important sections. Candidates want to know what they’ll earn and what they’ll get in return for their work. Being clear and upfront helps you attract the right people and saves time by filtering out mismatched expectations.

 Even if you can’t offer the highest pay, being transparent about benefits, perks, and working conditions shows professionalism and builds trust.

 **Clearly state:**

- The pay rate or range

- Any additional benefits or perks

- What’s unique about working at your venue

 **1. Be clear about pay — hourly or salaried**

 State the exact rate or a realistic range. If you’re not sure what to offer:

- Check what similar venues in your area pay (e.g. on Indeed, Caterer, or local job boards)

- Consider your expectations — are you asking for junior, mid-level, or senior baristas?

- If pay depends on experience, say that — but give a range

 Example:

 £11.50–£12.50 per hour depending on experience
£12.00/hour + tips, reviewed after 3 months Avoid phrases like “competitive pay” — it says nothing and frustrates candidates.

 **2. List any staff benefits**

 Even small perks can make a difference. Think beyond salary:

- Free or discounted food and drink

- Paid breaks or paid training

- Tips or tronc arrangements

- Staff socials or team meals

- Mental health support or well-being schemes

- Flexible hours or fixed rota patterns

- Paid holiday (especially if above statutory minimum)

 Example:

- Free coffee and staff meals on shift

- Paid breaks and holiday

- Team cuppings and barista training

- Tips shared evenly across the team

- Closed over Christmas and New Year

 **3. Mention opportunities for development (if applicable)**

 If you’re offering structured training, mentorship, or the chance to grow into a more senior role, say so.

 Example:

 We support your development with on-the-job training, optional SCA certification support, and the chance to move into a senior barista or trainer role.

 **Example section: Pay &amp; Benefits**

 Pay: £11.50–£12.50 per hour depending on experienceTips: Shared evenly across the team (usually £1–2/hr)
Benefits: 
- Free coffee and food on shift

- 28 days paid holiday (including bank holidays)

- Paid 30-minute breaks

- Optional SCA course support

- Team cuppings and socials

- No late nights — last orders at 4pm

 **Tips if you’re stuck**

- Ask yourself: “What would make someone want to stay in this role?”

- Be honest — it’s better to be transparent about limits than over-promise

- If your pay is on the lower side, highlight what else makes the job great (work/life balance, relaxed culture, training, progression, etc.)
