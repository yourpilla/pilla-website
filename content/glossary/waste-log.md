A waste log is a detailed record of all food and beverage items that are thrown away in a hospitality business. It logs the type and amount of waste, the reason for disposal and the cost. It's a tool used by restaurants, cafes, bars and hotels to manage their food waste.

Waste logs are good for hospitality because they help businesses save costs, improve stock control and support sustainability. By tracking what's being thrown away, managers can see patterns, adjust ordering and implement ways to reduce waste. It saves money and supports the environmental initiatives that are important to eco-aware guests.

Let's say you're the head chef at a busy beachside restaurant. You notice your seafood dishes aren't selling as well as you thought and a lot of waste is going out. By having a waste log you track exactly how much seafood is being thrown away each day. After a week you see you're throwing away about 5kg of mussels. With this information you can adjust your ordering, create new specials to use up excess stock or even change your menu to better match customer demand. The waste log is your secret weapon to running a more efficient and profitable kitchen.
