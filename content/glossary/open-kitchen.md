An open kitchen is a design concept where the kitchen is visible to the diner. This removes the traditional wall between the kitchen and dining room, so guests can watch their meal being made. Open kitchens usually have a counter or bar seating area that faces the kitchen, so diners get a front row seat to the cooking.

Open kitchens are trending in the hospitality industry because they create a unique dining experience. They add a bit of theatre to the meal, so guests can see the skill and artistry that goes into food preparation. This transparency also helps build trust in food quality and hygiene. For restaurant staff, open kitchens mean better communication between front and back of house, which can lead to better service and efficiency.

Let’s say you’re a chef at a cool bistro that’s just gone open kitchen. You might tell your team, 'Remember, with our new open kitchen we’re always on show. Let’s use this as an opportunity to show off our skills and engage with the guests. Keep your stations clean, communicate clearly and don’t forget to smile – you’re part of the show now!' This shows how an open kitchen changes the restaurant operation. Food prep becomes part of the whole dining experience, enhancing the interaction between chefs and diners.
