A function room is a multi-purpose space within a hotel or hospitality venue to host various events and get-togethers. These rooms are bigger than standard guest rooms and can be set up to suit different purposes, such as conferences, weddings, business meetings or private parties. Function rooms often have audio-visual equipment, adjustable lighting and flexible seating to cater for all needs.

Function rooms are a key part of the hospitality industry as they allow venues to offer more and attract a wider range of clients. By having dedicated spaces for events, hotels, restaurants and other establishments can generate extra revenue streams beyond their core business. Function rooms also help businesses build relationships with corporate clients, event planners and local communities, encouraging repeat business and word of mouth.

Let’s say you’re the events manager of a city centre hotel. A local tech company comes to you to host their annual conference, with 150 attendees. You think of your largest function room which can seat up to 200 people. You discuss with the client how the room can be set up with a stage for keynote speakers, breakout areas for workshops and a separate space for catering. You also mention that the room has a built-in projector and sound system so they won’t need to hire equipment. By showing off the flexibility and features of your function room you’ve probably just booked the business and potentially secured a long-term partnership with the company.
