A check in hospitality means the bill or invoice given to the customer at the end of their meal, stay or service. It lists the goods or services provided and the cost of each and the total amount due. The check is a formal record of the transaction between the establishment and the customer.

Checks are important in hospitality. They ensure accurate billing, track sales and smooth transactions. For restaurants and bars, checks help servers keep track of orders and mistakes. For hotels, checks break down room charges, amenities used and extra services so both guest and staff know what they are paying for.

Imagine this: You’re a server at a busy restaurant on a Friday night. A table of six finishes their meal and it’s time to present the check. You check the table’s orders in the point of sale system to make sure everything is correct, print the check, put it in a folder and bring it to the table with a smile. As you hand it over you say 'Here’s your check. Take your time and let me know if you have any questions.' Presenting the check professionally can leave a lasting good impression on your guests and can lead to better tips and repeat business.
