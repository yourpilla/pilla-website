Effluent is liquid waste or sewage from homes, businesses and industrial facilities. In the hospitality industry it’s all wastewater from hotels, restaurants and other establishments including water from toilets, showers, kitchens and laundry facilities.

Managing effluent is a key responsibility for hospitality businesses. It’s not just about complying with local regulations, it’s about creating a clean and hygienic environment for guests and staff. Effective effluent management also helps with water conservation and the environment. By implementing waste management systems, hospitality businesses can reduce their footprint and potentially lower their costs.

Imagine you’re the manager of a large resort hotel. Your monthly water bill has gone through the roof and guests are complaining about slow draining showers. You suspect there might be an issue with the effluent system. You’d need to call in a plumber to inspect the hotel’s wastewater pipes and treatment facilities. They might find a blockage in the main effluent line caused by years of grease build up from the kitchen. By fixing this now, you’d not only resolve the immediate problems but also prevent potential health hazards and environmental damage. This demonstrates how effluent is a real day-to-day issue in hospitality operations.'
