Risk assessment is a process used in the hospitality industry to find potential hazards, assess the likelihood and impact and implement measures to mitigate or eliminate those risks. It involves looking at all aspects of a hospitality business, from guest safety to food handling and developing strategies to address the risks found.

Risk assessment is important in hospitality because it protects guests, staff and the business itself. By finding and addressing the hazards hospitality businesses can prevent accidents, reduce liability and create a safe environment for everyone. This proactive approach not only keeps you compliant with health and safety regulations but also enhances the guest experience and the reputation of the business.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager preparing for the summer season. You’d do a risk assessment of your outdoor dining area. You’d find hazards like uneven paving that could cause trips, parasols that might blow over in the wind or food spoilage in hot weather. You’d then implement solutions like repairing the paving, securing the parasols and upgrading your refrigeration. By doing this you’ve reduced the risk of accidents or food safety issues and created a safer and better experience for your guests and staff.'
