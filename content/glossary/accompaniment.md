An accompaniment is a side dish, garnish or extra food item served with the main course to add to the overall dining experience. This can be veggies, sauces, condiments or starches that complement the flavours and textures of the main dish. Accompaniments add variety, balance and visual appeal to a meal, making it more satisfying and enjoyable for the diner.

In hospitality, accompaniments are key to menu planning, plate presentation and customer satisfaction. They allow chefs to show off their creativity and attention to detail, and give guests a more diverse and rounded meal. Accompaniments can turn a simple dish into a memorable meal and increase the perceived value of the meal.

Let’s say you’re a chef in a busy restaurant and you’ve just received an order for your signature grilled salmon. As you’re preparing the main dish, you think about the accompaniments that will go with it. You decide on a zesty lemon butter sauce, steamed asparagus and herb roasted potatoes. These accompaniments not only complement the flavour of the salmon but also make a beautiful plate that will wow your guests. By choosing and preparing these accompaniments, you’ve turned a piece of fish into a balanced, restaurant-quality meal that your diners will thoroughly enjoy.'
