Hashi is the Japanese word for chopsticks, the traditional eating utensils used in many Asian cultures. These little sticks, usually made of wood or bamboo, are used in pairs to pick up food. In Japanese cuisine, hashi are part of the dining experience, used for everything from sushi to noodle dishes.

Knowing hashi is important for hospitality professionals working in Asian restaurants or serving Asian food. Proper use and presentation of hashi show respect for the culture and add to the authenticity of the dining experience. For guests who don’t know how to use chopsticks, offering to show them how can be a lovely experience.

You’re a server at a high-end Japanese restaurant. A group of tourists who have never used chopsticks before sit down for dinner. You notice their hesitation when you put the hashi in front of them. You walk over to the table with a big smile and say, 'I see you’re new to hashi. Would you like me to show you how to hold them?' You then demonstrate the correct way, holding the top chopstick like a pencil and using it to pinch the food against the bottom chopstick. The guests thank you, enjoy their meal, leave with full bellies and a new skill, and continue their journey with fond memories of their dining experience.
