A bouncer is a security professional that works in bars, nightclubs and other hospitality venues to keep the peace and keep patrons safe. They're usually at the door to control access, check IDs and enforce dress codes. Bouncers also keep an eye out for any trouble and step in when needed to prevent or de-escalate conflicts.

Bouncers are a vital part of hospitality by creating a safe and enjoyable environment for guests. They're the first line of defence against trouble makers, underage drinkers and overcrowding. Just having them there can deter bad behaviour and make legit patrons feel safer. By keeping the peace bouncers help venues comply with licensing laws and protect their patrons effectively.

Imagine this: You're running a busy nightclub on a Saturday night. The queue outside is getting longer and you see a group of rowdy people trying to jump the queue. Your bouncer Mike approaches them calmly and says, 'Gentlemen, I appreciate the enthusiasm but you need to get to the back of the queue like everyone else.' When they protest Mike stands firm but polite and says, 'Our policy is fair for all our guests. You understand that?' His professional tone defuses the situation and they comply without incident. Inside you overhear a regular customer telling their friends, 'This place has great security. That's why I keep coming back.' This shows how a good bouncer can handle difficult situations, enforce venue policy and contribute to a great atmosphere for everyone.
