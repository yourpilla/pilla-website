A Banquet Captain is a senior team member who oversees the running of banquets and large events in hotels, restaurants and other hospitality venues. They manage the banquet team, liaise with the kitchen and ensure everything runs to plan. Banquet Captains are responsible for maintaining high standards of service, solving any problems that arise and being the link between the guest and the venue management.

The role of a Banquet Captain is key in the hospitality industry because they are the face of the event. They bring all the different parts of the operation together, from food service to guest satisfaction, so everything runs smoothly. Their leadership and organisational skills can make or break an event and the venue’s reputation and future business.

Imagine this: You’re a Banquet Captain at a 5 star hotel in London. A wedding reception for 200 guests is about to start. You brief your team on the evening’s timings, assign tasks and oversee the room set up. As guests arrive you notice the bride is worried about the seating plan. You reassure her and quietly adjust a few place settings. Throughout the night you keep an eye on service, food quality and timing. When a guest mentions a food allergy you quickly inform the kitchen and they prepare an alternative. Your calmness and problem solving skills ensure the wedding reception is a huge success and the couple and their guests have a night to remember, filled with joy and celebration.
