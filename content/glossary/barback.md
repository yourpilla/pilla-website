A barback is a support staff member who helps the bartenders run the bar. They're often referred to as the behind the scenes heroes of the bar, doing tasks like restocking supplies, changing kegs, cleaning glasses and keeping the bar clean. Barbacks don't serve customers directly but help the bartenders focus on making drinks and providing great service.

Barbacks are essential to the hospitality industry because they keep the bar and nightclub environment fast paced. They allow the bartenders to work efficiently by doing the time consuming tasks that would slow down service. This role is often seen as a stepping stone to becoming a bartender as it gives hands on experience in a bar.

Imagine this: You're running a busy pub on a Friday night. Your bartenders are slammed with orders and you notice they're running low on ice and clean glasses. That's when your barback Sam jumps into action. Sam fills the ice wells, restocks the glass racks and even changes a keg that's just run out. Thanks to Sam's quick thinking and hard work, the bar keeps ticking over and your customers are happy and well looked after all night.
