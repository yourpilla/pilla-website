A pastry chef is a cook who specialises in sweet and savoury bakes. They’re experts in pastries, desserts, breads and other bakes. Pastry chefs use their knowledge of ingredients, techniques and flavour combinations to make delicious and beautiful treats. Their role often involves menu planning, recipe development and overseeing the pastry section of the kitchen.

Pastry chefs are key to the hospitality industry because they add an extra layer to the dining experience. Their creations are the grand finale of a meal and leave a lasting impression on the guest. In hotels, restaurants and cafes pastry chefs contribute to the overall dining experience by offering a range of options from breakfast pastries to show stopping desserts. Their skills can make a venue stand out from the competition and bring in customers for their sweet treats.

Imagine this: You’re the head chef of a busy restaurant and you’ve just landed a big wedding contract. The bride has requested a show stopping croquembouche as the centrepiece for the dessert table. You turn to your pastry chef and say, 'Sarah we need your magic on this one. Can you create a croquembouche that will blow the guests away?' Sarah nods, excited by the challenge. Over the next few days she perfects the choux pastry, makes a silky smooth crème pâtissière and constructs a towering croquembouche covered in spun sugar. On the day of the wedding the dessert gets gasps of amazement and you get future bookings for your restaurant.'
