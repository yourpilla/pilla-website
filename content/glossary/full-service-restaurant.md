A full service restaurant is a restaurant that offers the whole dining experience, table service, menu, drinks. In these restaurants guests are seated by a host, order from a menu presented by a waiter and have food and drinks brought to their table. Full service restaurants often have a more upscale atmosphere and may have special dishes, wine lists and dessert menus.

Full service restaurants are a big part of the hospitality industry. They offer higher revenue per guest, upselling and a platform for chefs to showcase their skills. They also offer more job roles, from hosts and servers to sommeliers and bartenders, to the industry. Full service allows for more customer interaction to build loyalty and gather feedback.

Imagine you are the head chef of a new full service restaurant in the city centre. You have created a menu that features local ingredients and new cooking techniques. On a busy evening you are in the kitchen overseeing the kitchen staff preparing dishes to order while the front of house team are providing service. A group of regulars walk in and the waitstaff know their preferences and recommend a new wine to go with their favourite dishes. This personal service, combined with the food and atmosphere, is the full service restaurant experience and keeps guests coming back and talking.'
