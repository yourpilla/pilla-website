A concierge is a hotel staff member who helps with all sorts of requests and services. They’re the person you go to for information, recommendations and problem solving. Concierges book restaurant reservations, arrange transportation, get event tickets and provide local information. They’re usually found in 5 star hotels and resorts but some restaurants and luxury apartment buildings have concierges too.

The concierge role is valuable in hospitality because it adds to the guest experience. By providing personal service and insider knowledge concierges create memorable stays for guests. They can turn an ordinary stay into an extraordinary one by recommending hidden gems, getting hard to get reservations or solving unexpected problems. This level of service leads to higher guest satisfaction, positive reviews and repeat business.

Imagine this: You’re a concierge at a boutique hotel in London. A couple arrive to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. They ask you to plan a special evening. You get to work, book a table at a Michelin starred restaurant with a view of the Thames. You arrange a private car to take them there and back. As a surprise you coordinate with the restaurant to have a special dessert prepared. The next morning the couple are raving about their experience, praising your attention to detail. This is how a concierge can create unforgettable moments for guests and add value to their stay and the hotel’s reputation.'
