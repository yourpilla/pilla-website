Citron is a big, fragrant citrus fruit with a thick, bumpy skin and very little pulp. It's one of the original citrus fruits from which many others are derived. Unlike lemons or limes, citrons are used for their zest and pith, not their juice. The fruit has a distinctive aroma and a slightly sweet, acidic flavour that's less tart than a lemon.

In hospitality, citron is a versatile ingredient that adds depth and interest to many dishes and drinks. Its unique flavour profile makes it suitable for both sweet and savoury applications. Bartenders use citron zest to garnish cocktails or infuse spirits, chefs use it in desserts, preserves and savoury dishes. The fruit's aromatic qualities also make it useful for creating signature scents for hotels or spas, to enhance the guest experience.

You're a bartender at a 5 star hotel bar and a guest asks for a signature cocktail. You decide to show off your skills with a citron based drink. You muddle fresh citron zest with gin, add a splash of elderflower liqueur and top with champagne. As you present the drink you explain to the guest how the citron adds a citrus note that's different to lemon or lime. The guest is impressed by your knowledge and creativity, and has a memorable experience that adds to their stay at the hotel.'
