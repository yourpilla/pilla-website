Garde Manger is French for 'keeper of the food' and refers to both a position in the kitchen and an area of the kitchen. This role is all about cold food, salads, hors d’oeuvres, pâtés, terrines and charcuterie. The Garde Manger chef is responsible for creating cold food that looks good and tastes great and often showcases their artistic skills.

The Garde Manger is important in hospitality because it adds to the menu diversity and visual appeal of the restaurant. Cold food is often an appetiser or light meal and sets the tone for the dining experience. The Garde Manger’s creations can make a lasting impression on the guest and influence their overall satisfaction and perception of the establishment. In hotels and resorts, the Garde Manger is especially valuable for buffet, banquets and room service.

You’re the head chef at a boutique hotel and you’re preparing for a high profile wedding reception. You task your Garde Manger to create a show stopping charcuterie display as the focal point for the cocktail hour. The Garde Manger arranges an assortment of cured meats, artisanal cheeses, pickled vegetables and house made pâtés on beautiful platters. They also prepare a selection of cold canapés and refreshing salads for passed hors d’oeuvres. The Garde Manger’s creations impress the guests and complement the main course and overall make the hotel’s reputation for culinary excellence shine.'
