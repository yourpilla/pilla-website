A sommelier is a wine trained professional who knows everything about wine service and food pairing. They are experts in wine selection, storage and service, with in depth knowledge of wine regions, grape varieties and winemaking techniques. Sommeliers work in high end restaurants, hotels and wine bars where they curate wine lists, advise guests on wine choices and make sure wine service is perfect.

Sommeliers are key to enhancing the guest experience. They help customers navigate the wine list, suggest perfect pairings with the meal and can increase wine sales for the restaurant. Their expertise adds value to the service, makes guests feel looked after and potentially increase spend. For hospitality businesses a good sommelier is a major asset, increases customer satisfaction and revenue.

Imagine this: You’re running a fine dining restaurant on a Saturday night and a group of corporate execs walk in for a business dinner. They want to impress their clients but are overwhelmed by your wine list. Your sommelier steps in, chats with them about their preferences and meal choices and recommends a selection of wines to match each course. The clients are impressed by the sommelier’s knowledge and the service. The evening is a success, the bill is big and they book your restaurant for future business dinners. This is how a sommelier’s expertise can directly impact customer satisfaction, repeat business and revenue.'
