Portion control refers to the practice of managing and standardising the amount of food or drink served to customers in hospitality establishments. This involves measuring and serving consistent quantities of ingredients or finished dishes to ensure uniformity across all orders. Portion control helps maintain food quality, manage costs, and meet customer expectations. Proper portion control is a key factor in the success of hospitality businesses. It directly impacts profitability by reducing food waste and controlling ingredient costs. Consistent portions also contribute to a positive customer experience, as guests receive the same value for their money each time they visit. Moreover, portion control aids in menu planning, inventory management, and nutritional analysis, allowing businesses to operate more efficiently and comply with health regulations.

Let's say you're a chef at a popular restaurant. You've noticed that your signature pasta dish's profitability has decreased. After investigating, you realise that your kitchen staff have been eyeballing the pasta portions, often serving more than the recipe calls for. You implement portion control by providing each cook with a specific measuring tool for the pasta. Within a week, you see a significant reduction in ingredient usage and an increase in profits, all while maintaining customer satisfaction. This example shows how portion control can directly impact a restaurant's bottom line and overall efficiency.'
