Food labels are those little tags or markings on food packaging that tell us about the ingredients, nutritional content, allergens, production methods and other relevant info. They help us make informed choices about our food and comply with regulations. In the hospitality industry food labels are crucial for guest safety, meeting dietary needs and transparency in food service.

For hospitality professionals understanding and using food labels correctly is key to great service and guest trust. Food labels help kitchen staff quickly identify ingredients so they can accommodate special dietary requests or avoid allergens. They also help with inventory management, ensuring stock rotation and reducing food waste. By labelling in-house prepared food, restaurants and hotels can protect themselves from liability and show their commitment to guest safety and quality.

You’re a chef in a busy hotel restaurant. A guest with a severe nut allergy orders a salad and you need to make sure it’s nut free. You quickly check the labels on all pre-packaged ingredients, from the dressing to the croutons, to make sure they’re safe for the guest. You also check the labels on your mise en place containers to avoid cross-contamination. Thanks to clear and accurate food labelling you confidently prepare and serve a great, allergen-free meal, and the guest enjoys their dining experience without worry.
