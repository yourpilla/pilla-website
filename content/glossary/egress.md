Egress is an exit or way out of a building or space. In hospitality egress refers to emergency exits, fire escapes or any designated path to get out of a premises quickly and safely. Egress points are marked with illuminated signs and must be kept clear at all times.

Egress is key to safety in hospitality. Proper egress planning means guests and staff can get out quickly in case of an emergency like a fire or natural disaster. It’s a legal requirement in most countries, and failure to keep egress routes clear can result in big fines or even closure of your business.

Imagine this: You’re running a busy restaurant on a Saturday night and the fire alarm goes off. Panic starts to spread and you calmly tell your staff to get the guests to the egress points. Thanks to your egress planning and regular staff training, everyone gets out safely in minutes. After the all clear, the guests are raving about your team’s handling of the situation, and what could have been a disaster is now a tick in the box for your professionalism.'
