A dunnage rack is a sturdy, raised platform used in hospitality settings to store various items off the floor. These racks are typically made of durable materials like stainless steel or heavy-duty plastic and come in different sizes to suit various storage needs. Dunnage racks keep items at least 6 inches above the ground, helping to maintain cleanliness and comply with health and safety regulations.

Dunnage racks play a key role in hospitality by promoting hygiene and organisation. By keeping items off the floor, these racks prevent contamination from dirt, moisture, and pests. They also make cleaning easier, as staff can easily sweep or mop under them. In busy kitchens, storage rooms, or walk-in coolers, dunnage racks help maximise space and improve efficiency by allowing for neat, accessible storage of supplies.

Picture this: You're the head chef at a popular seaside restaurant. It's the height of summer, and you've just received a large delivery of fresh seafood. You direct your sous chef to store the boxes of fish and shellfish on the dunnage racks in the walk-in cooler. By using these racks, you ensure that the seafood stays fresh and uncontaminated, while also making it easy for your team to access during the busy dinner service. The raised storage also allows for better air circulation, helping to maintain the quality of your ingredients. Later, when the health inspector drops by for a surprise visit, they nod approvingly at your proper use of dunnage racks, contributing to your restaurant's excellent hygiene rating.'
