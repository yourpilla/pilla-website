A licensing fee is a payment to use a brand name, trademark or product. In hospitality this is often paying to operate under a well known hotel or restaurant chain's name. The fee is usually a percentage of revenue or a flat rate dependent on the agreement between the licensor and licensee.

Licensing fees are big in the hospitality industry because it allows businesses to leverage the brand recognition and customer loyalty. By paying these fees hotels and restaurants can tap into the existing marketing, operational systems and customer base. This means more bookings, more revenue and better guest satisfaction. For smaller businesses or independent operators, licensing fees can give access to resources and support that would otherwise be out of reach.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant owner looking to grow your business. You decide to open a franchise of a popular fast food chain. As part of the agreement you’ll pay a licensing fee to use the chain's name, logo and menu items. This fee might be 5% of your monthly revenue. In return, you get to use the chain's brand, benefit from their national marketing campaigns and get training and support for your staff. While the licensing fee is an ongoing cost, it will attract more customers and potentially increase your profits than operating as an independent restaurant.'
