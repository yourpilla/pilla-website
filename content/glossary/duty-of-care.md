Duty of Care means the legal and moral obligation to keep your guests and employees safe and well. This means taking reasonable steps to prevent harm, accidents or injuries on site. As a hospitality professional you need to keep the environment safe, train your staff and implement the necessary safety measures.

Duty of Care is key in hospitality because it impacts guest satisfaction, employee welfare and your business reputation. By putting safety and well-being first you create a trustworthy and reliable environment that guests will want to come back to. Plus fulfilling your Duty of Care protects your business from potential legal and financial losses that could arise from claims.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager and it’s a busy dinner service. You see a small puddle of water near the kitchen entrance. You’re aware of your Duty of Care so you quickly call a team member to clean it up and put a ‘Caution: Wet Floor’ sign in the area. By doing that you’ve potentially prevented a slip and fall accident and protected your guests and staff. This is how Duty of Care is part of your daily operations and ensures everyone in your business has a safe and secure environment.
