Guéridon service is a fancy way of saying food is prepared, finished or presented tableside on a mobile trolley or cart called a guéridon. This adds a bit of theatre to the dining experience and allows guests to see the final prep of their meal. The guéridon itself is a small wheeled table with a spirit lamp or other heating element so servers can cook, carve or assemble dishes right in front of the guests.

Guéridon service engages multiple senses. It’s a visual spectacle, fills the air with aromas and allows for personal interaction between staff and guests. It showcases the skill of the waitstaff and adds value to the meal beyond the food itself. For restaurants and hotels it’s a way to differentiate and justify the premium pricing.

Imagine you’re a server in a fancy French restaurant. A couple is celebrating their anniversary and orders Crêpes Suzette for dessert. You wheel the guéridon to their table with all the ingredients and equipment. As they watch you heat the pan, add butter and sugar, squeeze fresh oranges and pour in Grand Marnier. With a flourish you ignite the alcohol and the flames dance as you fold the crepes and coat them in the caramelised sauce. Finally, you plate the dessert and serve it to the starry-eyed couple. This show not only wows the diners but also gets the attention of the tables around them and might just increase orders for tableside dishes.'
