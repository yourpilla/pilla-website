A rolling rota is where shifts repeat in a cycle. Instead of making a new rota every week or month, managers set up a pattern that rolls over. So staff work the same sequence of shifts, days off and hours in a loop.

Rolling rotas are good in hospitality because they bring consistency and fairness. They balance workloads, make sure you’re covered during peak times and allow staff to plan their lives around a predictable schedule. This type of rota will increase employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.

Let’s say you’re the head chef at a busy restaurant. You might make a rolling rota where your kitchen staff work 5 days on, 2 days off. They’d rotate between mornings, afternoons and evenings. Chef Sarah might start Monday morning, work through Friday evening, have the weekend off, then start again Monday afternoon the following week. This would continue, giving Sarah and her colleagues a fair mix of shifts and they can plan their personal lives accordingly, ensuring a balance between work and leisure.'
