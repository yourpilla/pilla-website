SOP, or Standard Operating Procedure, is a detailed, written set of instructions that describes how to perform a routine activity in a hospitality setting. SOPs outline the exact steps needed to complete a task consistently and efficiently, ensuring that all staff members follow the same process every time. These procedures cover various aspects of hospitality operations, from check-in processes and room cleaning to food preparation and customer service protocols.

SOPs are vital in the hospitality industry because they maintain consistency, quality, and efficiency across all areas of a business. By following SOPs, staff can deliver a uniform experience to guests, regardless of who's on shift or how busy the establishment is. This consistency helps build trust and loyalty among customers, as they know what to expect each time they visit. SOPs also help train new employees quickly and effectively, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity.

Let's say you're a restaurant manager implementing a new SOP for table service. Your SOP might include steps like greeting guests within 30 seconds of seating, presenting menus, explaining daily specials, taking drink orders, and checking back after the first few bites of the main course. By following this SOP, your wait staff ensures that every guest receives the same high level of service, creating a positive dining experience that encourages repeat visits and positive reviews.'
