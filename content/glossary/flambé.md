Flambé is a cooking technique where you add alcohol to a hot pan to get a flash of flames. This method comes from the French word meaning 'flamed' and is often used for desserts or sauces. The alcohol is lit and you get a dramatic visual and a flavour to the dish.

Flambé adds theatre to dining, it's not just about the taste, it's about creating moments for your guests. When done tableside it's a performance that engages your diners and turns a meal into an event. It can turn an ordinary dinner into a conversation piece, creating memories that last long after the meal is over.

Imagine you're a chef in a 5 star restaurant. You've just made a classic Crêpes Suzette for a VIP guest. You wheel the trolley to the table and explain the history of the dish. Then you add Grand Marnier to the hot pan. The flames rise up, caramelising the sugars and infusing the crepes with a subtle orange flavour. The guest's eyes light up, matching the flames in the pan. As the flames die down you serve the dish, you've not just fed your guest, you've given them an unforgettable dining experience.
