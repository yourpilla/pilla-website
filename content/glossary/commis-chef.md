A Commis Chef is an entry level chef who works under the guidance of more senior chefs in the kitchen. They are often recent graduates from culinary school or starting their career in the industry. Commis Chefs do basic food prep, learn kitchen operations and take on more responsibility as they gain experience.

The role of a Commis Chef is important in hospitality because they are the foundation of the kitchen brigade system. They support senior chefs, keep the kitchen running smoothly and help during busy service. As they learn and grow they become the future leaders in the culinary world, so they are an investment for the long term success of any hospitality business.

So imagine you are the head chef of a busy restaurant. During service you look over and see your Commis Chef Sarah doing multiple tasks. She’s prepping vegetables, helping the sauce chef and plating dishes when needed. You make a mental note to give her a shout out and maybe give her more responsibility in the next few weeks. This is how a Commis Chef’s role is key to the kitchen and how their growth benefits the whole team.
