Usage rate in hospitality means the percentage of time an asset or service is in use compared to the total available time. This metric helps you measure efficiency and demand for different parts of your hospitality business - hotel rooms, restaurant tables or spa facilities. You calculate usage rate by dividing the time an asset is in use by the total time it's available and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.

For hospitality people, usage rate is a key performance indicator that informs decision making and resource allocation. It helps you identify peak times, underutilised assets and opportunities to improve. By tracking usage rates you can optimise staffing, adjust pricing and make informed decisions about adding or reducing services. This data driven approach will help you maximise revenue and improve the guest experience.

Let’s say you have a busy restaurant with a private dining room. You notice the room’s usage rate is only 30% on weeknights. To increase this you might introduce a weeknight special for small group bookings or partner with local businesses for corporate events. After implementing these you track the usage rate over the next month and see it increase to 60%. This will not only bring in more revenue but also justify keeping the private dining room as an asset for your restaurant.'
