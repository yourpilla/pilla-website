A Night Manager is a hospitality professional who runs the hotel during the night shift. They manage staff, deal with guest queries and ensure the hotel runs smoothly when most guests are asleep. Night Managers often deal with the unexpected, handle security, and get the hotel ready for the next day.

Night Managers are key to hospitality by providing 24/7 service and maintaining the hotel standards during off-peak hours. They help create a seamless guest experience, deal with late-night issues, and support the day team by completing admin tasks and reports. Guests feel safe knowing help is always available even in the middle of the night.

Imagine this: You’re the Night Manager at a city centre hotel. It’s 2am and a guest calls the front desk to complain about noise from the room next door. You quickly assess the situation, speak to the noisy guests and resolve the issue without disturbing other sleeping guests. Later, you help a business traveller with an early check-out, get their invoice ready, and book airport transfer. As dawn breaks, you brief the morning team on the night's events and prepare handover notes for a seamless transition to the day team.
