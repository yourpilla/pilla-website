An epicure is someone who loves good food and drink. This is someone with good taste who appreciates the nuances of flavour, presentation and the whole dining experience. Epicures are often knowledgeable about food, wine and other gourmet products and look for high quality, well-prepared meals.

In the hospitality industry, understanding and catering to epicures is key. These discerning customers expect high quality in their food and drink and the whole experience. They will pay premium prices for great food and will become loyal customers if their high standards are met. Epicures can also be vocal about great restaurants or bars so are valuable customers for any business.

Let’s say you’re a chef at a fine dining restaurant. You’ve just launched a new tasting menu and want to get feedback from your most exacting customers. You might tell your front of house staff, 'I’d love to hear what the epicures think of our new menu. Their opinions will really help us fine-tune the dishes.' By pleasing the epicures you’ll be improving the overall quality for all your customers and potentially getting recognition in the culinary world.
