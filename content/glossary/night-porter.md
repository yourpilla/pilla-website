A night porter is a hospitality person who works the night shift in hotels, providing services and support to guests in the late hours. They do lots of things, from check-ins and check-outs to guest requests and security. Night porters are often the first point of contact for guests during the quiet hours, so the hotel runs 24/7.

Night porters are key to hospitality by keeping guests happy and safe 24/7. They help hotels provide service 24/7, for late arrivals, early departures and any emergencies that may happen during the night. They allow guests to feel safe and looked after at all hours, and that's the guest experience.

Imagine this: You're a night porter in a busy city hotel. It's 2am and a guest calls the front desk and complains about noisy neighbours. You calmly deal with it by speaking to the noisy guests and ask them to keep it down. Then you call the complainant and offer them a free breakfast as a gesture of goodwill. You've turned a negative into a positive and shown the value of a good night porter in keeping guests happy.'
