A restaurant manager is the person in charge of the day to day running of the restaurant. They manage staff, customer satisfaction, finances and food quality and safety. Restaurant managers work long hours, evenings and weekends to keep the business running.

Restaurant managers are key to the hospitality industry. They are the link between staff, customers and owners, making sure everyone's needs are met. Their ability to multitask from staff training to inventory management directly affects the success and reputation of the restaurant. Good managers create a positive work environment, boost team morale and customer loyalty.

So let's say you're a chef in a busy city centre restaurant. Your restaurant manager Sarah notices wait times for main courses are getting longer. She spots a new trainee is struggling with plating. Sarah jumps in, shows the trainee how to plate efficiently and adjusts the kitchen workflow. Within minutes the backlog is cleared and customers are getting their food. This is how a good restaurant manager can resolve a problem quickly, keeping the kitchen running smoothly and customer satisfaction high.'
