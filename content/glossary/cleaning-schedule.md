A cleaning schedule is a plan that outlines when and how to clean and maintain specific areas of a hotel or restaurant. It includes daily, weekly and monthly tasks, with frequency, method and staff responsible for each task. This ensures all areas of the property are cleaned regularly and thoroughly, keeping the property hygienic and looking good.

In the hospitality industry a well implemented cleaning schedule is key to having a clean, safe and welcoming environment for guests. It prevents dirt and grime building up, reduces the risk of pest infestations and ensures all areas of the property are presentable at all times. A good cleaning schedule also helps staff manage their time, prevents tasks from being missed and can even extend the life of furniture and equipment through regular maintenance.

Let’s say you’re the manager of a busy restaurant. Your cleaning schedule might include tasks like wiping down tables and chairs after each use, sweeping and mopping the dining area every night, deep cleaning the kitchen weekly and a professional carpet clean monthly. By following this schedule you ensure your restaurant always looks its best, meets health and safety standards and provides a pleasant dining experience for your customers. The schedule also helps your staff know what needs to be done and when, so they can work more efficiently and not miss important cleaning tasks.'
