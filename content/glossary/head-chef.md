A Head Chef (also Chef de Cuisine) oversees everything from menu planning and ingredient sourcing to staff management and quality control. Head Chefs create the dishes, ensure food safety and the kitchen runs smoothly and efficiently.

The Head Chef is key in hospitality as they directly impact the food served, which is often the main draw for customers. They set the culinary direction of the restaurant, hotel or catering business and therefore influence the reputation and success of the business. Head Chefs also play a big part in cost control, staff development and the overall standard of the business.

Making sure that a Head Chef focusses on the correct tasks and has the correct skills to do that is key to their success. Here's some useful links:

So you’re a sous chef in a busy hotel restaurant. The Head Chef has just told you a food critic is in tonight. They quickly change the menu and delegate tasks to the kitchen team. You watch as they plate the critic’s dish and add the final touches. The Head Chef’s leadership and creativity pays off, and the review is glowing, leading to full bookings for weeks.'
