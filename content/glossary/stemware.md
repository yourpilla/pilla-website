Stemware is glassware specifically designed for serving and drinking various types of beverages, wine, champagne and cocktails. These glasses have long stems so you can hold the glass without warming the drink or leaving fingerprints on the bowl. The stem also lifts the bowl so you can swirl the drink and smell the aroma.

Stemware is important in the hospitality industry because it enhances the drinking experience and adds to the table setting. Different types of stemware are designed to complement specific drinks, bringing out the flavours and aromas. For example, a wide bowl red wine glass allows the wine to breathe, while a narrow flute preserves the bubbles in champagne. Using stemware properly shows you care and are committed to giving your guests the best experience.

Let’s say you’re a sommelier at a fine dining restaurant. A couple orders an expensive bottle of aged Bordeaux. You know to fully appreciate this wine it needs to be served in the right stemware. You choose large, balloon-shaped glasses with a wide bowl that tapers slightly at the top. As you pour the wine you explain to the guests how this shape allows the wine’s complex aromas to collect in the glass, enhancing their experience. The guests are impressed by your knowledge and attention to detail, and that adds to their overall enjoyment of the meal and the restaurant’s reputation.'
