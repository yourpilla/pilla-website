A drink station is an area in a restaurant, bar or hotel where drinks are made, stored and served. It will have equipment like ice machines, drink dispensers, fridges and storage for glasses and other bits. Drink stations can be behind bars, in kitchens or in self-serve areas for guests.

Drink stations are a crucial part of hospitality. They centralise drink making so staff can serve drinks to customers more efficiently. A well-laid-out drink station will speed up service, reduce waiting times and improve the overall guest experience. It will also help with consistency of drink quality and presentation across all staff.

You’re running a busy hotel restaurant during breakfast service. Your drink station has fresh juice, coffee, tea and water. As guests start to pour in, your staff can grab glasses, fill them with ice and dispense drinks without having to go back to the kitchen. This allows them to serve dozens of guests their morning drinks in minutes, keeping the queue moving and getting everyone’s day off to a great start.
