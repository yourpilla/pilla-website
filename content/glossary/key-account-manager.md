A Key Account Manager in hospitality is the person who looks after and grows the relationships with the biggest and most valuable clients or partners of a hotel, restaurant or other hospitality business. They are the main point of contact for these high value accounts, making sure their needs are met and their experience is exceptional. Key Account Managers maintain and grow these relationships, often negotiating contracts, resolving issues and identifying new opportunities for collaboration.

Key Account Managers are crucial in the hospitality industry because they bring in and retain big spenders who can have a big impact on a business’s bottom line. These could be corporate clients who book large numbers of rooms, event planners who book conferences or weddings or travel agents who bring in a steady stream of guests. By looking after these key accounts personally and attentively, hospitality businesses can build long term loyalty and increase revenue.

Let’s say you’re a Key Account Manager for a large hotel chain. One of your key accounts is a multinational company that books rooms for their travelling employees. You notice their bookings have dropped off recently. You reach out to your contact at the company to find out why. They tell you they’re concerned about the lack of workspace in the rooms. You work with your hotel team to create a new ‘business friendly’ room category with more desk space and faster Wi-Fi. You then present this solution to the client, addressing their concerns and potentially increasing their bookings. This proactive approach shows the value of a Key Account Manager in looking after and growing the most important business relationships in the industry.'
