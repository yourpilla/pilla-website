Hollowware is tableware that has a hollow or concave shape and is used to serve food and drink in the hospitality industry. This includes bowls, cups, saucers, gravy boats, soup tureens and serving platters. Hollowware is made from materials like silver, stainless steel or high-end china depending on the style and budget of the establishment.

Hollowware is important in the hospitality industry as it affects the presentation and service of food and drink. The right hollowware can make dishes look more appetising and professional. It also affects the functionality of service as well, as the right hollowware can keep food at the right temperature and make it easier for guests to enjoy their meal. In high-end restaurants and hotels, the quality and design of hollowware can reflect the attention to detail and commitment to excellence.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager preparing for a wine tasting event. You would instruct your staff like this: 'Tonight we will be using the crystal wine glasses from our premium hollowware. Make sure to polish each piece before setting the tables. The white wine glasses go on the right, red wine glasses in the middle and water goblets on the left. Don’t forget the silver spittoons for each table - they’re in the hollowware cabinet at the back.' This is how the term 'hollowware' is used in everyday operations to refer to specific types of serving ware, so staff know exactly what you need for a perfect setup.
