House wine is the standard, often cheaper wine that restaurants, bars and hotels offer as their go-to option. These wines are chosen by the establishment to provide good value for money and consistency. House wines are available by the glass or bottle and can be red, white or rosé. They're often bought in bulk or through special arrangements with wineries so they can offer them at a competitive price.

The concept of house wine is useful in hospitality because it simplifies the decision making for guests who feel overwhelmed by long wine lists. It also helps the establishment to have a steady stock and pricing structure. For budget conscious customers it's an affordable option without compromising on quality. From a business point of view, house wines have higher profit margins and contribute a lot to the bottom line.

Imagine this: You're a server at a busy Italian restaurant on a Friday night. A group of friends sit down and one asks, 'What's your house red?' You reply, 'Our house red is a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. It's a medium bodied wine with cherry and plum flavours. It goes well with our pasta and pizzas.' The guests like the simple recommendation and order a bottle to share. By offering a house wine you've made the ordering process easier, potentially increased the spend at the table and given the customers a happy experience.'
