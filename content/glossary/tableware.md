Tableware is the dishes, utensils and other things we use to serve and eat our food. This includes plates, bowls, cups, saucers, cutlery and glassware. In hospitality, tableware also includes serving dishes, platters and special items like oyster forks or champagne flutes.

Tableware is important in hospitality as it affects the dining experience. The right tableware can make the food look better, reflect the style of the establishment and the overall atmosphere. It's a practical necessity and a design element that can turn a simple meal into a special occasion. Good tableware can also make service smoother and more professional.

Let's say you have a new cocktail bar and you've created a signature cocktail to be served in a bespoke glass. This glass becomes part of your tableware and a conversation starter for your customers. When you train your staff you tell them how important it is to use this specific glass for the signature cocktail, how it makes the drink look and enhances the overall customer experience. You also teach them how to handle and clean the glasses so they look great and last long. This is an example of how tableware becomes part of your brand and service standards.
