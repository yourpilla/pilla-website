Hibachi is a Japanese term for a heating device but in the hospitality industry it’s a style of cooking where the chef cooks on a flat open grill in front of the guest. This style of cooking combines culinary skill with entertainment as the chef will often perform tricks and interact with the guest while preparing their meal.

Hibachi is a valuable concept in hospitality because it’s an experience that goes beyond just serving food. It’s an interactive atmosphere that can set a restaurant apart from the competition. By incorporating hibachi style cooking you can increase customer engagement, get repeat business and justify premium pricing for the enhanced experience.

So you’re a restaurant manager looking to increase your weeknight bookings. You decide to launch a ‘Hibachi Tuesday’ special. Your chefs are trained in hibachi techniques and cook at tableside grills, flipping shrimp into guests’ mouths and creating onion volcanoes. The event is a hit, guests are sharing on social media and booking back in. You’ve used the hibachi concept to create buzz, increase revenue and have a point of difference in a competitive market.'
