A menu board is a visual representation of food and drink offerings, found in restaurants, cafes and fast food outlets. It's a big, easy-to-read board that shows menu items, prices and sometimes images or descriptions of dishes. Menu boards can be static or digital, the latter allowing for quick updates and dynamic content.

Menu boards are key to hospitality by simplifying the ordering process and customer experience. They help customers make a quick decision, reduce queue times and can even increase sales by highlighting specials or high-margin items. For staff, it's a quick reference point to help with order accuracy and efficiency.

Imagine you're running a busy caf√© during lunchtime. Your digital menu board allows you to switch from breakfast to lunch menu with one click. As the weather turns cold, you can promote your new seasonal soup with an image and a limited-time price. This flexibility helps you respond to customer demand and increase sales while keeping your staff informed and customers engaged.'
