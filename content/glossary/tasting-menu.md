A tasting menu is a selection of small dishes that showcase a chef's skills and creativity. It's multiple courses, each with its own flavour profile and presentation. Tasting menus allow you to try many dishes in one meal, often with seasonal ingredients and new techniques. They can be any length, 5 to 20 courses, and take you on a culinary journey.

Tasting menus are great in hospitality because they give you a unique experience that sets you apart from the competition. Chefs can express themselves and their skills, and guests can try dishes they wouldn't normally order. Tasting menus also help with inventory and reduce food waste as chefs can plan and portion ingredients more accurately. And they usually command a higher price so you make more money.

You're the head sommelier of a luxury restaurant that's just launched a new tasting menu. The chef has created a 7-course menu with local seasonal ingredients. Your job is to pair each course with the perfect wine. You spend hours tasting the dishes and selecting the wines, considering acidity, tannins and flavour profiles. On the menu's launch night you guide the diners through each pairing, explaining how the wine enhances the dish. The guests love it and word gets out about your restaurant's tasting menu and wine pairings. Bookings increase and you're a must-visit restaurant.
