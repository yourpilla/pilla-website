An appetizer is a small dish served before the main event of the meal. It's meant to get your appetite going and set you up for what's to come. Appetizers can be as simple as olives or bread or as complex as soups, salads or small portions of hot or cold food. In some cultures they're called 'starters' or 'hors d'oeuvres.'

Appetizers are key to hospitality as they set the tone for the whole meal. They give you something to eat while you're looking at the menu and waiting for your main course. Well-crafted appetizers showcase a chef's creativity and the restaurant's style. They also pace the meal, giving the kitchen time to get the main courses ready while keeping you satisfied.

You're a chef at a busy Italian restaurant. You've just created a new appetizer - crispy fried zucchini flowers filled with ricotta and herbs. You add it to the menu and it's a hit. Guests love the delicate flavours and crispy texture. The appetizer not only increases sales but also enhances the dining experience, encouraging guests to try more adventurous main courses. Your new appetizer becomes a signature dish, attracting new customers and keeping regulars coming back for more.
