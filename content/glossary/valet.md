Valet is a service offered by hotels, restaurants and other hospitality venues where staff park and retrieve your car. This service includes greeting you, helping with your luggage and looking after your car. Valets are well trained in customer service and can drive all sorts of cars.

Valet service adds to the guest experience, convenience and luxury. It takes the stress out of parking, especially in busy city areas and allows you to transition from your journey to your destination seamlessly. For high end establishments valet parking is often seen as an expected amenity. It’s also an opportunity for staff to make a great first impression and set the tone for the rest of your visit.

You’re the front desk manager at a city centre hotel on a Friday evening. You’ve got a full house with several VIPs coming in. You brief your valet team, 'Tonight’s going to be busy. We’ve got the CEO of a major company arriving at 7pm. Make sure you’re ready to greet him at 7pm, help with his luggage and park his car safely. Remember every guest should feel like a VIP so keep those smiles on and stay focused. If you need backup don’t hesitate to call for support. Let’s make sure our valet service runs like clockwork tonight!'
