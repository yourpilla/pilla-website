Occupational safety is the practices, policies and procedures in the workplace to protect employees from harm and well-being. In the hospitality industry this includes measures to prevent accidents, injuries and health hazards that can occur during daily operations. It covers everything from handling cleaning chemicals to ergonomic considerations for staff who stand for long periods.

For hospitality professionals occupational safety is number one. Our industry has risks from slips and falls in kitchens to repetitive strain injuries for housekeeping staff. By focusing on safety we create a better work environment, reduce staff turnover and improve productivity. Plus a safe workplace equals happy employees which equals better guest experience.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager named Sarah. You notice your kitchen staff are running around with hot pots without proper protection. So you introduce a new occupational safety measure: all staff must wear heat resistant gloves when handling hot items. You also install non slip mats in high traffic areas. A month later you see a big reduction in minor burns and slip incidents. Your staff feel more secure, work more efficiently and your restaurant’s reputation for quality service improves. This is occupational safety in action - protecting your team and growing your business.'
