A hawker is someone who sells food, drinks or other goods from a mobile stall, cart or vehicle. In the hospitality industry, hawkers are often associated with street food vendors who serve local, authentic food at affordable prices. They’re everywhere in Asia, Africa and Latin America where they contribute to the local food culture and economy.

Hawkers are a big part of the hospitality industry by providing unique, authentic culinary experiences. They offer a taste of local flavours and traditions, and sometimes they’re tourist attractions in themselves. For many travellers, trying hawker food is part of experiencing a destination. Hawkers are also a source of inspiration for restaurant chefs looking to add street food-inspired dishes to their menus.

You’re a restaurant manager in Singapore where hawker culture is alive and well. You notice tourists asking where to find the best local street food. To enhance their experience you decide to add a 'Hawker’s Choice' section on your menu featuring dishes inspired by popular hawker stalls. You also train your staff to tell guests about nearby hawker centres so they can explore the local food scene beyond your restaurant. This adds value to their stay and taps into the hawker craze, potentially increasing your restaurant’s appeal and customer satisfaction.
