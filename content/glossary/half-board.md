Half board is a meal plan where hotels and resorts offer 2 meals a day, usually breakfast and dinner in the room rate. This is a convenient and often cost-effective way to manage your meals during your stay. Half board is different from full board, which includes all 3 meals, and bed and breakfast, which is just the morning meal.

Half board is a popular choice for many travellers and plays a big part in the hospitality industry. For hotels, it’s a way to increase revenue and keep guests on site for more of their stay. It’s especially attractive for families or groups who want to simplify their dining arrangements and budget. It also allows hotels to showcase their food and create a more immersive experience for guests.

Let’s say you’re a hotel manager preparing for a busy summer season. You decide to promote half board packages to get more bookings. You create a special menu for half board guests with local specialties and seasonal ingredients. This enhances the guest experience and helps you manage food costs and staff more efficiently. You train your front desk staff to explain the benefits of half board to guests at check-in, highlighting the convenience and value. By focusing on half board, you could see more bookings, increased guest satisfaction, and higher revenue per guest.
