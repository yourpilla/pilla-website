QSR stands for Quick Service Restaurant, a restaurant that focuses on fast food and service. They have a limited menu of items that can be prepared quickly, often with standardised ingredients and cooking methods. QSRs have counter service, drive-through and minimal table service. Examples are big chains like McDonald's, Burger King and KFC and local fast food joints.

QSRs are a big part of the hospitality industry because of their convenience and speed. They cater to customers who need quick meals on the go, so they’re perfect for lunch breaks, travel stops and busy families. QSRs also provide jobs for many entry level workers and are a training ground for those starting out in the industry. The QSR model has influenced other parts of the industry, fast casual concepts and streamlined service in full service restaurants.

So let’s say you’re running a hotel restaurant and you notice many guests are rushing out in the morning without having breakfast. You might consider adding a QSR style grab and go counter in the lobby. This could offer pre-packaged sandwiches, fruit cups and coffee for guests to grab and go. By going QSR you'd be able to serve more guests faster and potentially increase revenue and guest satisfaction.'
