A joint venture in hospitality is where two or more companies come together to share resources, expertise and assets to achieve a common goal. This can involve sharing risk, profit and operational responsibility. Joint ventures allow businesses to combine their strengths, enter new markets or take on projects that are too big or complex for one company to do alone.

Joint ventures are great in hospitality because they allow businesses to add to their offer, reach new customers and take on big projects. For example a hotel chain might partner with a local restaurant group to create a unique dining experience within their properties. This benefits both parties; the hotel gets a unique food and beverage offer, and the restaurant group gets to expand without the full cost of opening a new location.

Let’s say you’re a boutique hotel owner in a hot tourist destination. You’ve spotted a gap in the market for luxury eco-friendly accommodation. But you don’t have the expertise or resources to build a sustainable property from scratch. You decide to form a joint venture with a green technology company. Together you create a new eco resort that combines your hospitality know-how with their sustainable building practices. The joint venture allows you to share the financial risk, tap into your partner’s expertise and create a unique offer that sets you apart in the market. As a result, you can attract eco-conscious travelers and potentially add new revenue streams to your business.
