Order accuracy means getting the customer’s order right. This means every item ordered is prepared, presented and delivered exactly as requested. It’s everything about the order, from food and drink specs to special requests and modifications.

Order accuracy is key to customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in hospitality. When orders are right, customers get what they expect and have a positive experience and are more likely to come back. For businesses it reduces waste, minimises complaints and streamlines operations. Accurate orders also keep the workflow smooth in kitchens and bars and prevent delays and confusion.

Let’s say you’re a chef in a busy restaurant. A ticket comes in for a medium rare steak with mashed potatoes and no butter in the potatoes because of a dairy allergy. Order accuracy means you cook the steak to the right temperature and make sure the mashed potatoes have no butter. You check the ticket again before sending the dish out to make sure every detail matches the order. This attention to detail not only satisfies the customer but prevents potential health issues and having to remake the dish, saving time and resources.'
