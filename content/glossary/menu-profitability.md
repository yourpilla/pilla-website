Menu profitability is the financial performance of individual menu items and the menu as a whole in a hospitality business. It's about analysing the costs, prices and popularity of dishes to work out their contribution to the bottom line. This helps restaurant owners and managers decide which items to keep, modify or remove from the menu to make more profit.

Menu profitability is key to any food service business. By knowing which dishes are most profitable, businesses can design their menu to encourage customers to choose high margin items. This means restaurants can balance their menu between popular low margin items and less popular high profit items. Good menu profitability analysis will increase revenue, reduce food waste and improve overall financial performance.

Let's say you're a chef at a city centre restaurant. You've noticed your signature pasta dish is popular but has a low margin due to expensive ingredients. Using menu profitability analysis you decide to tweak the recipe, swap a few premium ingredients for more cost effective ones without compromising on taste. You also move the dish up the menu. As a result, you keep the dish popular and increase the margin significantly, contributing to the overall health of the business.
