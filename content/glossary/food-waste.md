Food waste is any edible food that’s thrown away, lost or uneaten. In the hospitality industry this can be unused ingredients, plate waste from customers and food that goes off before it’s used. Food waste happens at every stage from preparation to serving and storage. It’s a big issue that affects the bottom line and the environment.

Reducing food waste is a key focus for hospitality businesses. It saves unnecessary food costs and disposal costs and aligns with consumer expectations for sustainability. By managing food waste well, restaurants, hotels and cafes can be more efficient, reduce their carbon footprint and be seen as a responsible business.

Let’s take a fictional example. You’re the head chef at a busy beachside restaurant. At a staff meeting you notice a lot of seafood is being thrown away each week. You decide to implement a food waste reduction strategy. You start by training your kitchen staff to store seafood properly to extend its shelf life. You introduce a ‘catch of the day’ special to use up fish that’s near its use by date. You work with your servers to educate customers on portion sizes to reduce plate waste. After a month you’ve reduced your seafood waste by 30%, saved money and reduced your environmental impact. This is what can happen when you understand and address food waste in a hospitality business effectively.
