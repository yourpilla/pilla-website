A reservation system is a digital tool that allows you to manage bookings and guest info. It’s a central hub where you can see room availability, take reservations and store guest details. These systems often link with other hotel software so it’s a seamless experience for staff and guests.

Reservation systems are a game changer in the hospitality industry. You can increase occupancy rates, prevent overbooking and streamline the check-in process. With real-time room availability you can make informed decisions on pricing and promotions. They also store guest preferences and history so you can give personal service and build loyalty.

Let’s say you’re the manager of a busy restaurant. It’s a Friday night and you’re using your reservation system to the max. A regular calls to book a table for 4 at 8pm. You check the system and see you’re fully booked but there’s a table of 4 leaving at 7:45pm. You confirm the reservation, knowing you can turn the table around in time. The system sends a confirmation email to the customer and updates your floor plan. When the guests arrive you greet them by name and seat them at their favourite table - information you’ve stored in the system from previous visits. This level of efficiency and personalisation is all thanks to your reservation system and helps you deliver top service even on the busiest of nights.'
