Antipasti means 'before the meal' in Italian and refers to the appetisers or starters served before the main course in Italian cuisine. These little dishes are meant to whet the appetite and are usually cold. Cured meats, cheeses, olives, marinated vegetables and bread are all common. Antipasti can be served individually or as part of a larger platter, known as an antipasto platter.

Knowing antipasti is useful for hospitality professionals because you can offer an authentic Italian experience and increase the appeal of your menu. By including antipasti you can increase perceived value, get guests to try more dishes and potentially increase your average spend. It’s also a great way to showcase local or seasonal produce.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager at a trendy Italian-inspired bistro. You decide to introduce an antipasti hour from 4-6 PM to get early diners in and boost sales during the quietest part of the day. You create a special menu with a rotating selection of house-made antipasti – marinated artichokes, prosciutto-wrapped melon, buffalo mozzarella with cherry tomatoes. You pair these with a selection of Italian wines by the glass. This new offering will increase your early evening revenue and give your chefs the chance to try out new recipes and flavour combinations so your menu stays fresh and exciting.'
