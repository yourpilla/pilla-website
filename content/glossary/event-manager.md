An Event Manager is a hospitality professional who plans, coordinates and manages events from small meetings to large conferences. They oversee everything from venue selection to catering to entertainment to logistics. Event Managers work with clients to understand their needs and make sure every detail meets their expectations.

Event Managers are a key part of the hospitality industry. They bring in big revenue for hotels, restaurants and other venues by attracting and managing events. Their work builds a venue’s reputation and can lead to repeat business. Event Managers create memorable experiences for guests, that’s what hospitality is all about.

Imagine you’re the Event Manager at a city centre hotel. A local company contacts you to host their annual gala dinner for 200 guests. You’d meet with the client to discuss their brief, budget and requirements. Then you’d work with the hotel’s chef to create a bespoke menu, arrange the decor and book the entertainment. On the night of the event you’d oversee the setup, manage the staff and make sure everything runs smoothly. Your goal is to deliver a perfect event that exceeds the client’s expectations and showcases your hotel.'
