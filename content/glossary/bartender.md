A bartender is a trained professional who makes and serves drinks in bars, pubs, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality venues. They mix cocktails, pour beer and wine and are often the face of the business, interacting with customers. Bartenders need to know loads of drink recipes, understand flavour profiles and have great customer service skills.

Bartenders are key to the hospitality industry. They create the atmosphere, drive sales and contribute to customer satisfaction. Their expertise can turn a simple drink into an experience, get you back and get you telling your mates. Bartenders also manage stock, keep the bar clean and often handle cash.

Making sure that a Bartender understands their tasks and has the correct skills to do that is key to their success. Here's some useful links:

Imagine this: You’re running a busy cocktail bar on a Friday night. Your top bartender Alex is on fire. A group of regulars come in and Alex greets them by name, remembers their usual order and makes their drinks with a bit of flair bartending, tossing bottles and shakers. A couple at the end of the bar look unsure what to order. Alex notices, walks over with a smile and after a quick chat about their tastes makes them a bespoke cocktail that suits them perfectly. This is how a trained bartender can elevate the guest experience, drive sales and create a lively atmosphere that gets customers back.'
