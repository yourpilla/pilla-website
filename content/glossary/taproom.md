A taproom is a dedicated space where breweries, pubs or bars serve and showcase their beer directly to customers. It's a casual, welcoming space where customers can try different beers, often straight from the source. Taprooms have a range of beers on tap, including seasonal and limited edition ones, so customers can get a unique tasting experience.

Taprooms are a big part of the hospitality industry, especially for craft breweries and beer-focused businesses. They provide a direct link between the brewer and the customer, allowing for instant feedback and brand loyalty. Taprooms are a hub for beer enthusiasts to meet, learn about brewing and try new flavours. For hospitality professionals, understanding what a taproom is, is key to creating great experiences for beer-loving customers.

So imagine you're running a new craft brewery and you decide to open a taproom next to your brewery. On a busy Saturday afternoon you're giving a tour to a group of visitors. As you lead them into the taproom you say, 'This is where the magic happens for our customers. In our taproom we have 12 beers on rotation, our core range and seasonal specials. Customers can try flights of beer, full pints or even take home growlers of their favorite. We've designed the space to be comfortable and welcoming, with bar seating, tables and a view into the brewery itself. It's not just about serving beer, it's about creating an experience that connects our customers to our craft.'
