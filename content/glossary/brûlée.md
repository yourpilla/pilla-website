Brûlée means 'burnt' or 'scorched' in French. In hospitality, it’s most commonly associated with the dessert Crème Brûlée, a rich custard topped with a layer of caramelised sugar. The brûlée technique is to sprinkle sugar on top of a dish and caramelise it with a blow torch or under a grill to get a crispy, glassy surface.

The brûlée technique is a game changer in hospitality. It adds wow to a dish with both taste and presentation. The contrast of the crunchy caramel top and creamy custard in a Crème Brûlée, for example, is a multi-sensory experience. This isn’t limited to desserts; it’s used in savoury dishes too, to add depth and complexity.

Imagine you’re the head chef of a hip restaurant. A food critic is dining tonight and you want to impress. You decide to give your signature salmon dish a twist. Just before serving, you sprinkle brown sugar on top of the fish and brûlée it. The sugar caramelises and you get a sweet and slightly bitter crust that complements the rich, flaky salmon perfectly. The critic is blown away by the texture and flavour combination and raves about your use of the brûlée technique. This is how knowing culinary terms like brûlée can help you elevate your dishes and stand out in the competitive hospitality industry.
