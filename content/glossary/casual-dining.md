Casual dining is the middle ground between fast food and fine dining. These places offer table service, a chill vibe and moderately priced menu items. Casual dining restaurants have a varied menu with appetizers, main courses and desserts, often with a theme or cuisine focus. The decor is comfy and inviting, not fancy like an upscale restaurant.

Casual dining is a big part of the hospitality industry because it appeals to everyone. It's an option for those who want a sit down meal without the cost or formality of fine dining. This category caters to families, groups of friends and individuals looking for a nice meal at a reasonable price. Casual dining restaurants become neighbourhood institutions, with regular customers and a sense of community.

Letâ€™s say you're a chef opening a new restaurant in a busy shopping centre. You might go casual dining to appeal to shoppers and local office workers. Your menu could be comfort food with a modern spin, served in a warm and inviting space with an open kitchen. You'd train your staff to be friendly and attentive but not too formal. By creating this casual dining experience you'd want to be the spot for lunch meetings, after work dinners and weekend family meals, striking the balance between good food and a relaxed vibe that keeps customers coming back.
