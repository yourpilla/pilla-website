'86' means out of stock or not available. It’s a quick way to say a dish, drink or ingredient can’t be served. The origin of this is debated but it’s used in restaurants, bars and cafes across the industry.

This is a key part of hospitality speak because it allows staff to communicate quickly during busy service. When something is '86ed' all staff need to know so they don’t offer it to customers or take orders for it. This way, there is no disappointment and smooth service flow is maintained.

Imagine you’re a line cook on a Saturday night in a busy kitchen. The head chef yells '86 the salmon!' You know you’re out of salmon and can’t serve any more salmon dishes. You let the waiting staff know so they can inform the customers before they order. This quick communication prevents confusion and keeps the kitchen running smoothly even when you’re out of ingredients.
