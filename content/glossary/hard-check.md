A hard check in hospitality terms means a thorough and detailed inspection of a room or area of a hospitality business. This involves a full check of everything from cleanliness to functionality to ensure it meets the highest standards of quality and guest satisfaction. During a hard check staff will check everything from the condition of the linen and towels to the functionality of the appliances and fixtures.

Hard checks are crucial to a business’s reputation and quality. They help identify and fix problems before guests find them so guests have a seamless and enjoyable experience. By doing regular hard checks businesses can maintain their standards, reduce complaints and increase guest satisfaction. This proactive approach to quality control will lead to good reviews, repeat business and a strong reputation in the competitive hospitality industry.

Let’s say you’re a housekeeping supervisor at a 5 star hotel. You’ve just trained a new team member and want to make sure they understand the importance of a hard check. You might say, 'Okay Sarah let’s do a hard check on room 305 together. I want you to check every inch of this room as if you were the most fussy guest. Check under the bed for dust, test all the lights, check the grout in the bathroom and make sure the minibar is fully stocked. A hard check means we leave no stone unturned. This is what sets our hotel apart and brings our guests back.'
