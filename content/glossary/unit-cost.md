Unit cost is the total cost to produce, store and sell one unit of a product or service. In hospitality, this could be the cost of a single room night, a meal or a drink. To calculate unit cost, you divide the total costs by the number of units produced or sold. This will tell you how much each item or service costs your business to deliver.

Understanding unit cost is key in hospitality because it directly impacts pricing and profit. Knowing your unit cost allows you to price for a healthy margin. It also helps you identify where you might be overspending and where you could cut costs. For example, if you know the unit cost of a cocktail, you can price it competitively and make a profit. Unit cost also guides decisions on menu changes, room rates or whether to continue to offer certain services.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager deciding whether to keep a popular but expensive dish on the menu. You calculate the unit cost of the dish, including ingredients, labour and overhead, is £15. You’re selling it for £22, so your profit per dish is £7, which looks good at first glance. But when you compare this to other menu items with higher profit margins, you might decide to replace this dish with something more cost-effective. Or you could look for ways to reduce the unit cost, maybe by sourcing ingredients differently or streamlining the prep process. This way, you’re using unit cost data to make informed decisions that grow your restaurant’s profit.'
