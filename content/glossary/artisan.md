Artisan means a skilled craftsperson who makes by hand, often using traditional methods and top quality ingredients. In hospitality, we use this term to describe food and drink made with love, care and attention to detail and a focus on quality over quantity. Artisan products are made in small batches so you have more control over the process and end up with unique and delicious products.

The word artisan is valuable in hospitality because it tells your guests you care about quality and craftsmanship. By using this word on your menu or marketing, you can differentiate yourself from places that serve mass-produced products. Artisan products often cost more because of the perceived value, which can increase revenue for your business. Featuring artisan products will attract the discerning customer who appreciates the skill and effort that goes into making these items.

You’re a chef at a hip bistro, and you’re revamping your dessert menu. You’ve partnered with a local chocolatier who hand tempers chocolate and creates unique flavour combinations. On your menu, you might describe a new dessert as an 'artisan chocolate tart' and highlight the craftsmanship and quality of the dessert. When a guest asks about the dish, you can explain the artisanal process of the chocolate, the chocolatier’s expertise, and the locally sourced ingredients. This adds value to the dish and gives your wait staff a story to tell the guest, which will enhance their experience and potentially increase sales of the dessert.
