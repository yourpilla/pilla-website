    A touchpoint is any moment of interaction between a guest and your business.
    This includes both physical and digital interactions, from the first time
    they visit your website to check-out. Touchpoints can be direct, like
    talking to a receptionist, or indirect, like reading reviews. They happen
    before, during and after a guest's stay and shape their overall experience
    and perception of your brand.

A touchpoint is any moment of interaction between a guest and your business. This includes both physical and digital interactions, from the first time they visit your website to check-out. Touchpoints can be direct, like talking to a receptionist, or indirect, like reading reviews. They happen before, during and after a guest's stay and shape their overall experience and perception of your brand.

Touchpoints matter because they are the building blocks of the guest experience. Each interaction is an opportunity to wow, delight or disappoint. By mapping and optimising touchpoints you can create a seamless guest journey and increase satisfaction and loyalty. Well-managed touchpoints can turn first-time visitors into repeat customers and brand advocates.

Let’s say you run a trendy café. You’ve identified several key touchpoints: your social media presence, the greeting at the door, the menu presentation, the food quality, and the payment process. You decide to focus on the menu presentation. You train your staff to enthusiastically describe daily specials, highlighting local ingredients. You also redesign the menu with eye-catching graphics and clear descriptions. As a result, you see an increase in sales of featured items and positive feedback about the dining experience. This touchpoint has increased guest satisfaction and your bottom line, proving that focusing on these moments of interaction works.'
