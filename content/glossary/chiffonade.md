Chiffonade is a culinary technique used to finely slice leafy herbs or vegetables into long, thin strips. The term comes from the French word for 'made of rags' or 'in ribbons'. To create a chiffonade, you stack leaves on top of each other, roll them tightly, and then slice across the roll to produce delicate ribbons. This method is commonly used for herbs like basil, mint, or sage, as well as leafy greens such as lettuce or spinach.

In hospitality, chiffonade is a valuable skill that enhances both the visual appeal and flavour distribution of dishes. It allows chefs to create elegant garnishes that add a touch of sophistication to plates. The fine strips of herbs or vegetables produced by this technique release their flavours more effectively, enhancing the overall taste experience for diners. Chiffonade also ensures that herbs are evenly distributed throughout a dish, providing a consistent flavour in every bite.

Let's say you're a sous chef at a high-end restaurant, and you're preparing a summer salad. The head chef asks you to chiffonade some fresh basil for the dish. You carefully stack the basil leaves, roll them tightly, and slice them into fine ribbons. These delicate green strips are then sprinkled over the salad, adding a burst of colour and a fragrant aroma. The diners are impressed by the presentation and enjoy the evenly distributed basil flavour throughout their meal. Your skilful use of the chiffonade technique has elevated a simple salad into a memorable dining experience.'
