A Rôtisseur is a chef who roasts meats. This chef is an expert in roasting all types of meat to get the perfect balance of flavour, texture and presentation. The word comes from the French word 'rôtir' which means 'to roast'. A Rôtisseur's expertise goes beyond cooking; they know the ins and outs of different cuts of meat, seasoning methods and the perfect cooking time and temperature for each type of protein.

A Rôtisseur is essential in many hospitality environments, especially in high-end restaurants and hotels. Their skills contribute to the quality and reputation of the establishment's food. A good Rôtisseur can turn a simple roast into a gourmet experience, creating dishes that will bring customers back. In a busy kitchen the Rôtisseur's ability to produce perfectly roasted meat every time can be the difference between a good meal and a great one. Their expertise also helps with menu planning, food cost control and maintaining the high standards of fine dining.

So you're the head chef of a busy steakhouse and you've just employed a new Rôtisseur and you can't wait to see what they'll bring to the menu. On their first night you ask them to cook a roasted rack of lamb for a VIP. Your new Rôtisseur gets to work, selects the perfect cut, seasons it beautifully and roasts it to perfection. When the dish is served the VIP is so impressed they ask to meet the chef. This positive feedback not only boosts the team's morale but also the restaurant's reputation. You realise you made a great decision in hiring a Rôtisseur as their expertise has added a new dimension to the menu and increased customer satisfaction.'
