EHO = Environmental Health Officer. They work for the local authority to make sure businesses including hospitality businesses comply with health and safety regulations. They inspect premises, investigate complaints and enforce food hygiene standards to protect public health.

EHOs are key to the hospitality industry. They keep standards of cleanliness and food safety high in restaurants, cafes, bars and hotels. By following their guidance and passing inspections businesses can build customer trust and avoid legal problems. EHOs visits keep hospitality staff on their toes so best practices are always followed.

Imagine this: you’re the head chef of a busy restaurant. One day an EHO turns up for an unannounced visit. You show them around your kitchen, proudly showing them how your team follows food safety procedures. The EHO checks your food storage, preparation areas and staff hygiene practices. You pass the inspection with flying colours. The EHO gives you a few minor suggestions for improvement which you implement straight away. This positive interaction with the EHO not only keeps your restaurant open but also boosts your reputation for high standards.'
