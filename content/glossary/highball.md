A highball is a spirit and a mixer, served over ice in a tall glass. Examples are gin and tonic, whisky and soda, rum and cola. The name highball comes from the glass itself, a highball glass.

Highballs are a staple in many bars and restaurants because they’re easy to make, customizable and appeal to everyone. They’re seen as a refreshing alternative to neat spirits or more complicated cocktails. For bartenders and servers, knowing how to make a good highball is a basic skill used daily. It’s also a drink that can be upsold by suggesting premium spirits or unique mixers.

So you’re working behind the bar on a Friday night and a customer comes in and asks for something refreshing but not too sweet. You might suggest a highball, explaining it’s a tall, refreshing drink that can be tailored to their taste. You could offer a gin highball with tonic and a splash of elderflower cordial or a whisky highball with ginger ale and a dash of bitters. By knowing the versatility of highballs you can quickly and easily meet their needs and show off your mixology skills effectively.
