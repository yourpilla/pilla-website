Sous vide means 'under vacuum' in French. It's a cooking technique where you seal food in airtight plastic bags and cook it in a temperature controlled water bath for hours. This gives you precise temperature control resulting in food cooked to the same texture and flavour every time.

Sous vide is great for hospitality because it has many benefits. First, it's perfect every time, with no over or undercooking of expensive ingredients. Second, it's food safe, ensuring consistent temperatures. Third, it improves kitchen workflow, as dishes can be prepared in advance and finished quickly during service. Fourth, it allows you to achieve textures and flavours that are hard to get with traditional cooking methods.

Let's say you're the head chef of a busy restaurant. You have a big event coming up with 100 guests and they all want their steaks cooked to perfection. With sous vide you can cook all the steaks to the exact same doneness hours before service. When it's time to serve you just need to sear the steaks for a crispy exterior. This means consistency, less stress during service and you can deliver high quality dishes even during peak hours. Sous vide has changed the way kitchens operate by providing precision, consistency, and efficiency in the hospitality industry.
