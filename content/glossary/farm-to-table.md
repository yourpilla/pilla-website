Farm to table means ingredients are sourced directly from local farms and delivered to restaurants, cafes or other food service outlets. It’s all about freshness, seasonality and supporting local agriculture, emphasizing the whole journey of food from the farm to the plate.

Farm to table has become super popular in hospitality because it has many benefits. For guests it means fresher, tastier food with more nutrients. For chefs it means access to top quality seasonal ingredients to inspire menu planning. From a business perspective it allows establishments to stand out in a crowded market and appeal to eco-conscious consumers. Plus it supports local economies and reduces carbon footprint from long distance food transportation.

Let’s say you’re a chef at a busy city centre restaurant. You decide to go farm to table by partnering with a local organic farm. Each morning you get a delivery of freshly picked vegetables, fruits and herbs. You can then create a daily specials menu based on what’s in season and at its peak flavour. You might have dishes like 'Just picked strawberry and goat cheese salad' or 'Herb roasted chicken with farm fresh vegetables'. You can also invite the farmers to come in and talk to your staff about their growing methods so your team can better explain the menu to curious diners. This direct connection between farm and kitchen not only improves your food but also gives you a unique selling point for your restaurant.
