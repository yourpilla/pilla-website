Gratuity, commonly known as a tip, is a voluntary payment given by customers to service staff as a show of appreciation for good service.

Tipping, or a tip, is a voluntary payment from customers to service staff as a thank you for good service. In the hospitality industry, tipping is expected and can be a big chunk of a worker's pay. Tipping can be in cash, added to the bill or included in the credit card payment.

Tipping is big in the hospitality sector. It motivates staff to give good service as good service equals more tips. For many hospitality workers, tipping is a big part of their income sometimes even more than their base wage. This way businesses can keep menu prices lower and staff can still earn a living wage. It also gives customers a way to reward good service.

Imagine you're a server at a busy restaurant, a group of 6 comes in for dinner and you give them great service throughout the meal. You recommend wine pairings, accommodate dietary restrictions and make sure their experience is top-notch. At the end of the meal the bill comes to £200. The group is happy with your service and leave a 20% tip, adding £40 to the bill. This tip directly rewards your hard work and boosts your earnings for the shift. It's a win-win: the customers feel they've rewarded you properly and you get tangible recognition for your good service.'
