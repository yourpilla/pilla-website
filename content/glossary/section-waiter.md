A section waiter is a hospitality professional who serves guests in a specific area or 'section' of a restaurant, café or dining establishment. This role involves taking orders, delivering food and drinks, answering menu questions and ensuring overall customer satisfaction in their section. Section waiters work as part of a bigger team, each covering different areas of the dining room to provide service to all guests.

The concept of section waiters is key to many hospitality businesses. By sectioning off the dining area, restaurants can ensure each guest gets personal attention and prompt service. This prevents overlooked tables, reduces waiting times and allows staff to build relationships with guests. It also allows for better communication between the front of house team and the kitchen as each waiter becomes an expert on the needs and wants of the guests in their section.

Imagine you’re a section waiter in a busy Italian restaurant on a Friday night. You’re on the outdoor terrace and have 8 tables. As you start your shift you quickly familiarise yourself with your section, noting which tables are occupied and at what stage of their meal each group is. A party of 4 arrive and you seat them at table 5, introduce yourself as their section waiter for the night. You take their drink orders, answer their menu questions and top up their bread basket. Meanwhile you notice table 3 are finishing their main course so you prepare to clear their plates and offer the dessert menu. By focusing on your section you can service all your tables, anticipate their needs and give each guest a great dining experience.
