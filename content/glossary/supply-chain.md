Supply chain is the network of people, organisations, activities, information and resources involved in producing and delivering a product or service from supplier to end customer. In hospitality, this means everything from sourcing ingredients for restaurant meals to buying linens for hotel rooms. The supply chain covers all the steps from raw materials to finished product including manufacturing, packaging, transportation and storage.

A well managed supply chain is key to success in hospitality. It means consistency, on time delivery and cost effectiveness. For restaurants, it means having fresh ingredients daily. For hotels, it’s having a steady supply of amenities and rooms fully stocked. Efficient supply chains help businesses control costs, reduce waste and maintain high standards of service. They also allow for flexibility to change to customer demands and market trends.

Let’s say you’re a chef at a busy seaside restaurant. You have a reputation for serving the freshest seafood. Your supply chain might involve local fishermen who deliver their catch to your kitchen every morning. You also work with a produce supplier who sources organic vegetables from nearby farms. Your beverage supply chain includes a local brewery and a wine distributor. By managing these relationships and keeping everything running smoothly, you can maintain the quality and consistency your customers expect. When a heatwave hits and demand for chilled white wine sky rockets, your well established supply chain allows you to increase your order and meet customer demand without any issues.'
