A cycle menu is a type of menu that rotates on a fixed schedule, typically over a period of several weeks or months. It offers a different set of dishes each day, repeating the cycle once it's completed. This approach allows for variety while maintaining a structured and predictable menu plan. Cycle menus are commonly used in various hospitality settings, including hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, and cruise ships.

Cycle menus are valuable in hospitality because they help streamline operations, reduce food waste, and control costs. By planning menus in advance, chefs can better manage inventory, standardise portion sizes, and negotiate bulk purchases with suppliers. This system also helps kitchen staff become more efficient as they become familiar with the recurring dishes. For guests, cycle menus offer a balance between variety and familiarity, which can be particularly appealing in long-term stay situations or for regular customers.

Let's say you're the head chef at a busy hotel restaurant. You might implement a four-week cycle menu for your breakfast buffet. Week one might feature Belgian waffles on Monday, eggs Benedict on Tuesday, and so on. This pattern repeats for four weeks before starting over. This allows you to plan your staffing, purchasing, and prep work efficiently. You can also easily accommodate seasonal changes or special events by tweaking specific days within the cycle without overhauling the entire menu structure. Your regular guests appreciate the variety, while your kitchen team benefits from the predictability and routine.'
