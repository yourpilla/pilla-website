Dry storage is a designated area in a hospitality business where non-perishable food and supplies are stored at room temperature. This area is cool, dry and well ventilated to keep products in good condition and extend shelf life. Items found in dry storage are canned goods, grains, pasta, spices and paper products.

Dry storage is a critical part of food safety and inventory management in hospitality. By keeping dry goods organised and at your fingertips you can streamline kitchen operations, reduce waste and maintain consistency in food prep. Dry storage also helps you track stock levels, rotate products to prevent spoilage and always have the ingredients you need to meet customer demand.

Picture yourself as the head chef of a busy restaurant. You've just received a big delivery of dry goods, flour, sugar and various spices. You've put them away in your dry storage area, newer products behind older ones to rotate properly. Later during the dinner service your sous chef quickly finds the exact spice needed for a popular dish because of your well-organised dry storage. Your kitchen is running smoothly even during peak hours, demonstrating how effective dry storage can impact your restaurant's success.'
