A liquor licence is a legal document that allows a business to sell and serve alcohol. It’s issued by local or state authorities and outlines the rules and regulations the business must follow when selling alcohol. The licence will specify what types of alcohol can be sold, what hours alcohol can be sold and where on the premises alcohol can be consumed.

For hospitality businesses a liquor licence is gold. It can increase revenue, attract more customers and enhance the overall dining or entertainment experience. Bars, restaurants, hotels and nightclubs rely on liquor licences to offer full service to their customers. Without one they would be limited in what they can offer and potentially lose out on big dollars and customer satisfaction.

Let’s say you’re Sarah the restaurant manager and you’ve just been appointed to run a new Italian restaurant in the city. The owners want to serve wine with meals but they don’t have a liquor licence yet. As the manager it’s your job to get one. You’ll need to gather all the paperwork, attend council meetings and make sure the restaurant meets all the requirements. Once you have the licence you can start offering a wine list, enhance the dining experience and potentially increase your average spend. You’ll also need to train your staff on responsible service of alcohol and implement systems to comply with the licence conditions.'
