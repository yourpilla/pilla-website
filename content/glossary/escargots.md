Escargots are land snails that are cooked and served in their shells with butter, garlic and herb sauce. Escargots is French for snails and has become a common term in the culinary world.

In hospitality, escargots are a touch of luxury and French tradition. They’re often on the menu of high end restaurants as a starter or appetiser. Serving escargots can add to the perceived quality and authenticity of a French or European inspired venue. They’re also an opportunity for staff to show off their knowledge of French cuisine and how to serve them properly.

You’re a server at a high end French bistro. A guest asks about the escargots on the menu. You say with confidence, 'Our escargots are locally sourced land snails, cooked in the Burgundy style. They’re baked in their shells with a rich butter sauce and garlic and parsley. We serve them with special tongs and a small fork so you can extract the snails from their shells. It’s a French classic that pairs beautifully with our house Chablis.'
