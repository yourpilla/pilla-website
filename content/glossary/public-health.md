Public health is the science and practice of protecting and improving the health of populations through education, policy and research for disease prevention. In the hospitality industry, public health means measures taken to keep guests and staff safe. This includes cleanliness standards, food safety protocols and guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

For hospitality workers, public health is key to providing a safe environment for guests. It means regular hand washing, proper food handling, clean facilities and being up to date with health regulations. By putting public health first, hospitality businesses can build trust with their customers and have a good reputation.

Let’s say you’re a hotel manager during a flu outbreak. You’d increase cleaning protocols, provide hand sanitisers throughout the property and train staff to identify symptoms. You might also work with local health authorities to stay up to date with the situation and adjust your operations accordingly. These are examples of how public health is applied in real life hospitality scenarios to keep guests and staff safe while maintaining service.
