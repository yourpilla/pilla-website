A jockey box is a portable draft beer system to serve cold beer at events or locations without permanent beer taps. It’s a cooler or insulated container with coils or plates that chill the beer as it flows through so it’s served at the perfect temperature. The term jockey box likely came from the days when beer was delivered by horse-drawn wagons and the driver (or jockey) sat on a box that held the beer.

Jockey boxes are useful in hospitality because you can serve draft beer in many different situations, from outdoor festivals to catered events. They’re especially handy for pop-up bars, food trucks and temporary venues where installing a permanent draft system isn’t possible. Jockey boxes keep the beer quality and temperature, which is key to customer satisfaction and reducing waste.

Imagine you’re managing a large outdoor wedding reception. The couple has asked for their favourite craft beer on tap but the venue doesn’t have a built-in draft system. You’d use a jockey box to serve cold, fresh draft beer to the guests throughout the event. You’d set up the jockey box near the bar area, hook it up to the kegs and make sure your staff knows how to use it. That way you can offer a premium beer experience even in a temporary situation and impress the happy couple and their guests with excellent service.
