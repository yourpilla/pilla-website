F&B stands for Food and Beverage and encompasses all aspects of food service and drink provision in the hospitality industry. This means everything from fine dining restaurants and casual cafes to bars, room service and catering. F&B covers menu planning, food preparation, service delivery and beverage management including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
 
F&B is the backbone of the hospitality industry and for many businesses is the main revenue generator. It directly impacts guest satisfaction, repeat business and reputation. Well executed F&B can differentiate a property from the competition, create memorable experiences for guests and increase profitability. From a boutique hotel’s breakfast service to a high end restaurant’s tasting menu, F&B touches every part of a guest’s stay or visit.
 
Making sure that an F&B Team focusses on the correct tasks and has the correct skills to do that is key to their success to your F&B as a whole. Here's some useful links:

Let’s say you’re the F&B manager at a city centre hotel. You might use the term in a staff meeting like this: 'Our F&B revenue is up 15% this quarter thanks to the new rooftop bar and our new room service menu. But we need to work on our breakfast service to reduce guest wait times during peak hours.' This shows how F&B covers different services and how it’s used to talk about both good and bad in hospitality operations.
