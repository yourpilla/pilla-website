A barback station is an area in a bar or restaurant where barbacks store all the essentials for the bartenders. This includes ice bins, glassware, garnishes, mixers and all the bar tools. It's designed to make restocking easier and have everything the bartenders need at their fingertips during service.

The barback station is key to a smooth running bar. It allows barbacks to anticipate what the bartenders need, reduce interruptions and keep service flowing. A well-organised barback station will increase productivity, improve customer service and make the bar a more organised and professional place.

Imagine this: You're a barback at a busy cocktail bar on a Friday night. The bartenders are working at lightning speed and you notice the mint is running low. Thanks to your well-stocked barback station you grab a fresh bunch of mint from the fridge, chop it up and top up the garnish tray without breaking a sweat. The bartenders don't even have to ask â€“ you've anticipated their needs and kept the drinks flowing. This is the barback station in action; you're supporting the bar team and the service is seamless.
