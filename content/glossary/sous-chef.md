Imagine this: You're the Sous Chef at a busy city centre restaurant on a Saturday night. The Head Chef is off sick and you're in charge. As you step up to lead, you delegate to the line cooks, expediting orders and keeping an eye on food quality. A large party arrives with a last minute dietary request. You adapt quickly, create a special dish to meet their needs and keep the kitchen running smoothly. Your leadership and thinking on your feet mean the service is a success, proving what a Sous Chef can do.
