    A microbrewery is a small independent brewery that produces small amounts of
    craft beer. They brew less than 15,000 barrels a year and focus on quality,
    flavour and unique recipes rather than mass production. Microbreweries
    experiment with different ingredients and brewing techniques to create beers
    that are different from mainstream commercial offerings.

A microbrewery is a small independent brewery that produces small amounts of craft beer. They brew less than 15,000 barrels a year and focus on quality, flavour and unique recipes rather than mass production. Microbreweries experiment with different ingredients and brewing techniques to create beers that are different from the mainstream commercial offerings.

Microbreweries are a big part of the hospitality industry by offering unique and locally brewed beer to customers. They add value to restaurants, bars and hotels by offering exclusive high quality beers that can't be found anywhere else. This exclusivity can attract beer enthusiasts and locals alike, increasing foot traffic and the overall dining or drinking experience. Many microbreweries also offer tours and tastings which can be a draw for tourists and locals looking for an authentic artisanal experience.

Imagine you're the manager of a hip gastropub in Brighton. You've partnered with a local microbrewery to offer their seasonal IPA exclusively in your pub. At your weekly staff meeting you might say, 'Our partnership with Seaside Microbrewery is a winner. Their summer citrus IPA is flying out. Make sure you're recommending it to customers who ask for something different. Also, remind them it's brewed just down the road â€“ people love supporting local businesses.' This shows how featuring microbrewery products can be a selling point and conversation starter and increase the customer experience and sales.
