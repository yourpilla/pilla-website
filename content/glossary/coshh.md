COSHH stands for Control of Substances Hazardous to Health. It's a set of rules in the UK that makes employers control substances that can harm workers' health. In hospitality, this covers a wide range of products from cleaning chemicals to cooking oils and even some foods. COSHH is about assessing risks, implementing controls and training.

COSHH is a big deal in hospitality because we handle harmful substances every day. From the cleaning products used in housekeeping to the chemicals in the kitchen and bar, proper handling is key to keeping staff and guests safe. By following COSHH guidelines, we reduce the risk of accidents, injuries and long-term health issues. It also helps us comply with the law and have a safe, professional working environment.

Let's say you're a chef in a busy kitchen. You're using a new oven cleaner that's very effective but contains strong chemicals. To follow COSHH you would first assess the risks by reading the product's safety data sheet. Then you would ensure proper ventilation in the kitchen, provide staff with the correct PPE like gloves and goggles, and train them on how to use the cleaner safely. You would also store the product in a secure, designated area and have a plan in place for accidental spills or exposure. You're not just ticking boxes; you're actively protecting yourself and your team.'
