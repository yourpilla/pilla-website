Continental service is where the server presents the food on large platters and the guest serves themselves. This is used in high end restaurants, hotels and catered events. In continental service the server approaches the guest from the left side, holds the platter with their left hand and the guest takes the food with the serving utensils provided.

Continental service is important in hospitality as it’s a balance between formal dining and guest autonomy. It’s elegant and gives the diner control over their portion sizes. It’s also good for large groups so it’s popular for banquets and weddings. Continental service shows off the skill of the server as they have to maintain good posture and balance while presenting heavy platters.

So you’re running a hotel restaurant and you’re hosting a corporate gala. You’ve decided to use continental service for the main course. Your servers approach each table and present platters of roasted chicken and grilled vegetables. Guests help themselves and love the interactive experience. As the night goes on you notice how seamless the service is and how little disruption to conversations. The corporate clients are impressed with the professional yet personal touch and you’ve upped their dining experience with your service style.'
