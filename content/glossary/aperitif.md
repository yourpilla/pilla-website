An aperitif is a drink you have before a meal to stimulate your appetite. It's a light, dry and often slightly bitter drink that gets your palate ready for what's to come. Common aperitifs are vermouth, champagne and light cocktails like a Negroni or Aperol Spritz.

Aperitifs are a big part of hospitality. They create a relaxed vibe, encourage socialising and set the scene for the meal to come. Offering aperitifs can increase drink sales and give your guests a chance to unwind before their main course.

Imagine you're a restaurant manager. You've just launched a new aperitif menu with house-made vermouth and seasonal cocktails. To promote it, you train your staff to suggest aperitifs when guests are seated and explain how each drink pairs with the menu. You notice that tables that order aperitifs have a more relaxed and enjoyable dining experience and more often result in higher overall satisfaction and revenue.
