A split shift is a schedule where an employee’s day is split into 2 or more periods, with a significant break in between. In hospitality, this means working peak hours, breakfast and dinner service, with a long break in between. This way businesses can staff up for busy times without overstaffing during quiet times.

Split shifts are good for hospitality because they allow managers to optimise staffing to match customer demand. By scheduling employees for split shifts, restaurants and hotels can have enough staff during rush hours without paying for unnecessary labour during quiet times. This can save operational costs and maintain high service during peak times.

Let’s say you’re a restaurant manager of a busy bistro. You notice your busiest times are 11 am to 2 pm for lunch and 6 pm to 10 pm for dinner. To manage this you might schedule your best server, Sarah, for a split shift. Sarah would work 11 am to 2 pm, have a 4-hour break, and then work 6 pm to 10 pm. This way, you have your top performer on the floor during your busiest times, when you need her most, and avoid overstaffing during the quiet afternoon hours.'
