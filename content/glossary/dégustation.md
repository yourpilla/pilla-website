Dégustation means a carefully selected tasting menu, with small portions of many dishes. This is a culinary journey to taste many flavours and textures, to see the chef’s skills and creativity. Dégustation menus often have innovative combinations and cooking techniques, to show you the full scope of the restaurant’s cuisine.

For hospitality professionals, knowing and executing dégustation menus is a skill. These menus are a way to showcase the best ingredients, techniques and flavours your establishment has to offer. They will elevate your restaurant’s reputation, attract foodies and create memorable dining experiences that will set you apart from the competition. Dégustation menus also allow chefs to try new dishes and see what customers like, which can lead to new additions to the regular menu.

Let’s say you’re a sommelier at a fine dining restaurant and the chef has just launched a new dégustation menu. Your job is to match the perfect wine to each course. You would start by tasting each dish, noting the flavours, textures and intensities. Then you would select wines that complement or contrast with each course to enhance the overall experience. For example you would pair a light and crisp white wine with a delicate seafood starter, a full bodied red with a rich meat course and a sweet dessert wine with the final course. By mastering dégustation wine pairings you’re not just serving drinks – you’re creating a complete sensory experience for your guests.'
