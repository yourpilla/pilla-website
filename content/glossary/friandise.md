Friandise, pronounced 'free-ahn-deez', is a French word for small sweet treats served at the end of a meal. These little goodies can be petit fours, chocolates, macarons or other small pastries. Friandises are usually free and are the final flourish to the meal.

In hospitality, friandises are key to guest satisfaction and leaving a lasting impression. These little indulgences show attention to detail and add a touch of luxury to the meal. By offering friandises, restaurants and hotels can differentiate themselves from the competition and make the meal end on a high note. The presentation of the treats also gives the chef an opportunity to showcase their creativity, completing the dining experience with elegance.

Imagine you’re a pastry chef at a top-end restaurant. You’ve just finished preparing the friandises for the evening service. As the guests finish their desserts, you place a small plate with a dark chocolate truffle, a pistachio macaron, and a tiny lemon tart. The waitstaff then present the treats to the guests and explain each one. The guests' eyes light up at the surprise and they savour each bite, talking about the flavours and textures. This final flourish leaves them with a positive lasting impression of their meal, making them more likely to return and recommend your restaurant to others.
