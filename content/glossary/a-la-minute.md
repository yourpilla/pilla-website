A la minute means 'to order' or 'at the minute' in French. In the hospitality industry it means dishes are prepared fresh, after the customer has ordered. This way each dish is made to order, keeping its quality, freshness and temperature when served to the guest.

A la minute cooking is the foundation of good food service in restaurants, cafes and hotels. It allows chefs to customise dishes to the guest’s preference and dietary requirements. It also reduces food waste as items aren’t pre-prepared in bulk. By cooking a la minute, restaurants can offer more menu items.

Imagine this: you’re the chef de cuisine of a busy bistro. A server comes to you with an order for a medium rare steak with sautéed vegetables. Instead of pulling a pre-cooked steak from the warmers you start cooking it from scratch. You sear the steak to perfection while tossing fresh vegetables in a hot pan. Within minutes you’ve created a hot, fresh meal cooked to the customer’s exact specification. That’s a la minute cooking in action, delivering a better experience for your guests.'
