Coffee chaff is the papery skin that comes off the coffee beans during the roasting process. It's a by-product that's often discarded but has some uses in the hospitality industry. When coffee beans are roasted, the chaff separates from the bean and is collected in the roaster's chaff collector. It's light, flaky and looks like small pieces of paper or leaves.

Coffee chaff matters in hospitality because it's an opportunity for sustainability and innovation. Many cafes and restaurants are now finding ways to use this by-product instead of throwing it away. Some use it as a natural fertiliser for plants, others incorporate it into composting systems. In larger operations, coffee chaff can be used as biomass fuel or even as an ingredient in some food products. By using coffee chaff, hospitality businesses can reduce waste, save costs and appeal to eco-conscious customers.

Letâ€™s say you're a barista at a busy cafe that roasts its own coffee beans. You notice your cafe produces a lot of coffee chaff each week. You suggest to your manager that instead of throwing it away, you could partner with a local community garden. The garden could use the chaff as mulch or compost, and in return, they could supply your cafe with fresh herbs and edible flowers. This reduces waste and creates a positive relationship with the local community, providing your cafe with fresh local ingredients to add to your food and beverage offerings.'
