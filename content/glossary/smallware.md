Smallware is the smaller, handheld items used in food service and prep. Utensils like spoons, forks and knives, kitchen tools like whisks, tongs and spatulas. In restaurants and cafes, smallware also includes tableware items like salt and pepper shakers, napkin holders and condiment dispensers. These are cheap and easily replaceable but play a big part in the daily operations of hospitality businesses.

Smallware is key to hospitality because it affects the guest experience and operational efficiency. Properly stocked and maintained smallware means smooth service whether it’s having enough teaspoons for a busy cafe or the right serving utensils for a hotel buffet. It also contributes to the overall presentation and professionalism of your business. Imagine running a bar without cocktail shakers or a restaurant without enough forks - it would be madness!

Let’s say you’re the head chef of a busy restaurant. You’ve just launched a new menu item - a sizzling fajita platter. You realise you need to order specific smallware to serve this dish properly: cast iron skillets to keep the fajitas hot, special tongs for guests to serve themselves and small ramekins for the various sauces. By understanding smallware you ensure your new dish is not only tasty but also presented and served in the best way possible for your guests.'
