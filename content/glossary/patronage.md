    Patronage is the regular custom or support given to a business, especially
    in the hospitality industry. It's the ongoing relationship between a venue
    and its customers, where customers keep coming back and spending money at
    the same place. This goes beyond transactions; it's about loyalty,

Patronage is the regular custom or support given to a business, especially in the hospitality industry. It's the ongoing relationship between a venue and its customers, where customers keep coming back and spending money at the same place. This goes beyond transactions; it's about loyalty, preference and a connection between the business and its patrons.

For hospitality people, understanding and nurturing patronage is key to long-term success. Regular patrons not only provide a steady income stream but also are brand ambassadors, recommending your business to their friends and family. By building strong patronage, you create a loyal customer base that can help you through slow periods and build your reputation in the community.

Let’s say you're a bartender at a local pub. You see a group of friends come in every Friday night for drinks and dinner. Over time, you learn their names, their favourite drinks and even bits about their lives. You make an effort to remember these details, so their usual table is ready and their drink is prepared as they walk in. This personal service not only makes them feel special but also builds their patronage, ensuring your pub is their go-to spot for their weekly catch-up. Your attention to detail and great service turns these casual customers into loyal patrons who bring in a lot of business to your pub.
