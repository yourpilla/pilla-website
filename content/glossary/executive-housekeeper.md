An Executive Housekeeper is a top management role that oversees all housekeeping operations in a hotel or hospitality business. This includes managing staff, standards, budget and guest satisfaction. Executive Housekeepers report to the General Manager and work closely with other department heads to maintain the overall quality of the property.

The Executive Housekeeper is key to the reputation and success of a business. They ensure guest rooms, public areas and back of house are clean, hygienic and well maintained. This impacts guest satisfaction, repeat business and the image of the business. They also manage inventory, control costs and implement cleaning procedures.

Sarah, Executive Housekeeper at a city centre hotel, arrives at work early to review the day's occupancy report. She sees a large group check in later in the day and adjusts the staff schedules to ensure enough room attendants are on duty. Later she runs a training session on new eco-friendly cleaning products and does a walk through of the public areas to maintain standards. When a VIP guest complains about a maintenance issue Sarah contacts the engineering department to get it sorted. At the end of her shift she writes a report for the General Manager highlighting the day's achievements and areas for improvement.
