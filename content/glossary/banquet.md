A banquet is a big formal meal or feast to celebrate a special occasion or honour someone or a group. In the hospitality industry a banquet means serving a multi-course meal to a large number of guests at the same time. These can be weddings, corporate events, award ceremonies and charity fundraisers. Banquets require a lot of planning, coordination and execution from various departments within a hospitality venue.

Banquets are big business in the hospitality industry and showcase a venue’s capabilities. Hotels, restaurants and event spaces can show off their culinary skills, service and ability to handle large events. Successful banquets can lead to repeat business, word of mouth marketing and reputation.

You’re the banquet manager at a 5-star hotel. You’ve been asked to manage a high-profile corporate awards dinner for 500 guests. You work with the sales team to understand the client’s requirements then work with the kitchen to design a menu that caters for various dietary needs. You set up the ballroom making sure the tables are perfect and the audio-visual equipment is working. On the night you manage a team of 50 staff, ensuring the service runs like clockwork and all courses are served at the right temperature and time. Your attention to detail and ability to handle last minute changes means the event is a huge success, earning you a glowing review from the client and potentially more revenue in the future.'
