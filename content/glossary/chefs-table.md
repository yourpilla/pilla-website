A Chef's Table is a special experience where you sit at a table inside or near the kitchen and watch the chef and kitchen team cook your meal. This exclusive seating gives you a front row seat to the culinary action and often comes with a special menu or tasting.

Chef's Tables are valuable in hospitality because they create a memorable and interactive experience for the guest. They show off the skill and artistry of the kitchen team and add a personal touch to dining. This can increase revenue by offering a premium experience and can also boost the restaurant's reputation and attract more customers.

So you’re a restaurant manager at a luxury property and you’ve just launched a Chef's Table. You tell your staff, 'Our new Chef's Table seats six and has a 10-course tasting menu with wine pairings. It’s for special occasions or guests looking for something extra special. Make sure to mention it to regulars and those celebrating milestones.' This way you’re arming your team to upsell this experience and create memories for your guests.
