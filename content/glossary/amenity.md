An amenity is something a hotel provides to make life more comfortable and enjoyable for guests. From toiletries and towels to spa services and in-room entertainment systems, amenities can vary greatly depending on the type of hotel but all add to the guest experience.

Amenities are key in hospitality as they directly impact guest satisfaction and can be the deciding factor when a customer chooses where to stay or dine. Well chosen amenities can make you stand out from the competition and create a memorable experience that encourages repeat visits and great reviews. They also give you the opportunity to upsell and increase revenue.

Let’s say you’re a hotel manager and it’s holiday season. You decide to add a new amenity, a complimentary welcome drink for guests upon arrival. You’ll need to train your front desk staff on how to offer and serve the drinks, make sure you have enough stock and maybe even create a non-alcoholic option for families with kids. This simple amenity can make a great first impression and set the tone for a good stay, which could lead to better reviews and more bookings in the future.'
