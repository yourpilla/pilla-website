A keg is a cylindrical container to store, transport and serve beer or other carbonated drinks. Made of stainless steel or aluminium, kegs come in various sizes but the most common is the half barrel keg which holds 58.6 litres or 15.5 US gallons of beer. Kegs are designed to keep beer fresh and carbonated by using pressure to dispense the drink through a tap system.

Kegs are a big part of the hospitality industry especially in bars, pubs and restaurants. They allow establishments to serve beer efficiently and keep it fresh for longer periods. Kegs also reduce waste compared to individual bottles or cans making them a cost-effective option for businesses. Using kegs can also enhance the overall drinking experience for customers as draught beer is perceived to be fresher and more flavorful.

Imagine youâ€™re a bartender in a busy pub on a Friday night. You notice the beer from one of your popular lagers is pouring slow and foamy. You quickly realize the keg is empty or almost empty. You call out to your colleague, 'Hey I think we need to change the keg for the lager. Can you grab a fresh one from the cellar while I finish serving these customers?' Your quick thinking ensures minimal disruption to service and keeps both your customers and manager happy. This is how understanding keg systems and their maintenance is a key skill for bar staff to keep things running smoothly.
