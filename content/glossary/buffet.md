A buffet is a self-serve style of dining where food is laid out on a long table or counter and guests serve themselves. It has a variety of dishes, hot and cold, salads, desserts and drinks. Buffets can be found in hotels, restaurants, events and catering services, a great way to feed large numbers of people.

Buffets are big in hospitality because it’s a cost-effective way to feed many guests at once. It offers a wide range of food options to cater to different dietary needs and preferences. Buffets also eliminate the need for table service, which is very useful during peak hours or in establishments with limited staff. For hotels and resorts, buffets are often a popular choice for breakfast, brunch or special events, as it adds to the overall experience.

You’re the head chef of a busy hotel restaurant and you’re tasked to create a Sunday brunch buffet that will attract both in-house guests and locals. You decide to offer a mix of breakfast classics, made-to-order omelettes, a carving station with roast beef and international dishes to cater to different tastes. To ensure smooth service you assign staff to different stations, replenish dishes regularly and maintain cleanliness. As the buffet becomes a hit, you see increased bookings for Sunday brunch and positive feedback from guests, which contributes to the hotel’s reputation and success.'
