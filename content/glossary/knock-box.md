A knock box is a container used in cafes, coffee shops and restaurants to collect used coffee grounds after brewing espresso. It's made of durable stuff like stainless steel or plastic and has a padded bar across the top. Baristas knock the portafilter against this bar to empty the used coffee grounds into the box below.

Knock boxes are an essential tool for keeping clean and efficient in busy service areas. They allow baristas to quickly get rid of used grounds, keep their workspace tidy and maintain a smooth flow during peak hours. By containing the mess, knock boxes stop grounds from clogging sinks or creating slip hazards on the floor.

Imagine yourself as a barista in a busy cafe on a Saturday morning. You've just pulled a perfect shot of espresso for a customer's latte. With a quick flick of the wrist you tap the portafilter against the knock box, getting rid of the used grounds. This simple action allows you to move on to the next order without missing a beat, keeping your station clean and your service smooth. As the morning rush continues you'll do this dozens of times, grateful for the knock box that keeps you in control of the chaos of a busy coffee service.'
