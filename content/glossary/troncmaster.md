A Troncmaster is the person who manages and distributes the tronc, a pot of service charge or tips collected from customers in hospitality businesses. The Troncmaster collects, records and fairly distributes these funds to eligible staff members. They make sure the process is transparent, fair and tax compliant.

The Troncmaster is key to staff morale and fairness in hospitality. By managing the distribution of tips and service charge they ensure all staff get their fair share of customer tips. This can have a big impact on staff satisfaction and motivation as tips are a big part of hospitality workers' income.

Imagine you are the head waiter in a busy restaurant. After a crazy Saturday night you gather the team to distribute the tips. As the Troncmaster you have recorded all cash tips and credit card gratuities. You explain to the team how you have calculated each personâ€™s share based on hours worked and job roles. By being transparent and fair you keep the team morale high even on the busiest of nights.
