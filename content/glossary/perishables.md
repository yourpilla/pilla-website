Perishables are food items with a short life span that will spoil or go off if not stored or used properly. These include fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, meats and some baked goods. In hospitality perishables are a key part of food service operations and need to be managed carefully to maintain quality and reduce waste.

Managing perishables is key to running a successful hospitality business. How you handle these items directly impacts food quality, customer satisfaction and profitability. By monitoring inventory, rotating stock and storing correctly you can reduce waste, control costs and deliver fresh food to your customers.

Imagine you’re a chef in a busy restaurant. You’ve just received a big delivery of fresh seafood for the weekend’s special. You check the fish, store it at the correct temperature and update your inventory system. You also brief your kitchen staff on how to handle and store the perishables. Throughout the weekend you monitor the seafood usage and adjust the menu as needed to use all the fish before it goes off. This careful management of perishables means you can deliver great dishes, reduce waste and keep your reputation for quality intact.'
