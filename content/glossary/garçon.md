Garçon is a French term used to address male waiters in restaurants. It literally means 'boy' in English, but in a hospitality context, it’s a polite way to get a waiter’s attention. Although once common, it’s fallen out of favour in many modern restaurants, especially outside of France.

In the hospitality industry, understanding terms like garçon helps staff to recognize and respond to different ways guests will try to get your attention. It’s part of providing good service and being prepared for different cultural expectations. Even if you don’t use or encourage the term in your business, knowing it will help you react professionally if a guest uses it.

Imagine you’re working in a French themed bistro in London. A group of tourists come in, clearly excited for their 'authentic' French dining experience. As you approach their table, one of them calls out 'Garçon!' You may not want to be addressed that way, but you recognize the term, smile, and introduce yourself by name. This way you’ve acknowledged their cultural attempt while subtly encouraging a more personal way of addressing you for future interactions.
