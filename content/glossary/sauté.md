Sauté is a cooking method where you quickly fry food in a small amount of hot fat or oil in a pan over high heat. The word comes from the French 'sauter' which means 'to jump' as that's what the food does in the pan when cooked this way. Sautéing is used to cook a multitude of foods from veggies to meats and is loved for its ability to brown food quickly and retain moisture and flavour.

Sautéing is an essential skill in hospitality especially in restaurant kitchens. It's a quick and efficient way to cook during service times. The technique is universal and used in all cuisines and is the foundation of many popular dishes. Master the sauté technique and your kitchen staff can produce flavourful, textured dishes every time, which is key to customer satisfaction and repeat business.

Imagine yourself as a chef in a busy hotel restaurant. It's dinner service and you've just received an order for a chicken stir-fry. You heat the pan, add a bit of oil and sauté the chicken pieces until golden. Then you sauté the vegetables, tossing them in the pan to cook evenly. The sizzle and the aroma in the kitchen tells you you're cooking up a good one. In a few minutes, you've sautéed your way to a delicious dish that will please your guests and bring them back for more.
