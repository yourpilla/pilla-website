Menu planning is the strategy of deciding what to put on the menu in a restaurant, café or other food service business. It's choosing recipes, portion sizes, pricing and laying out the menu. Menu planning also considers ingredient availability, seasonality, target market and the overall concept of the business.

This is a big part of hospitality management as it directly affects customer satisfaction, profitability and operational efficiency. A well planned menu can attract customers, streamline kitchen operations, reduce food waste and increase sales. It also helps with inventory management, staff training and consistency of food quality. By designing your menu carefully you can create an identity for your business and stand out in a crowded market.

Let’s say you're the head chef of a trendy bistro in London. You have to create a new spring menu. You start by researching what’s in season from local suppliers. You then brainstorm dishes that feature these ingredients and fit with your bistro’s modern European concept. You consider your kitchen team’s skills, equipment and prep time for each dish. You also think about your target market - young professionals who like innovative but approachable food. After a few iterations and taste tests you finalise a menu that includes nettle and goat cheese tart, pan seared sea bass with asparagus and rhubarb crumble for dessert. You price these dishes to make a good profit margin but still competitive. Then you design the menu layout to feature these new spring specials. This is menu planning in action, where creativity meets business strategy.'
