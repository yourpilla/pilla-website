Room turnover (or room turn around) is the process of getting a room or accommodation ready for the next guest after the previous guest has checked out. This includes cleaning, restocking supplies and making sure everything is perfect for the next guest. The turn around process involves changing bed linen, sanitising surfaces, restocking amenities and a full inspection to maintain the room's quality and cleanliness standards.

Room turnover is a key part of hotel operations because it affects guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. Quick and efficient turn around means hotels can maximise occupancy and revenue by getting rooms ready for new guests as soon as possible. It also means each guest gets a clean and well maintained space, which is the foundation of a great experience and repeat business.

Imagine you're the head housekeeper at a busy beach hotel during peak season. A big group has just checked out and another one is arriving in 3 hours. You quickly get your team together and assign tasks to each member to get the room turn around done. As you work you keep an eye on the clock, knowing a quick and thorough turn around is key to meeting the incoming guests' expectations and the hotel's reputation. By streamlining the process and using a checklist, you get the room turn around done just in time and the new guests are impressed with their clean and prepared rooms.
