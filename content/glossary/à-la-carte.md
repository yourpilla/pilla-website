À la carte means by the card in English. In hospitality, it refers to a menu where each dish is listed separately with its own price. This way guests can choose individual items to create their meal rather than a set menu or package deal. À la carte menus give diners the freedom to mix and match dishes to their taste and budget.

À la carte is key in hospitality because it gives flexibility to both the establishment and the customer. For restaurants, it allows for more dishes to be offered, showcasing the chef’s skills and creativity. It also helps with inventory management as dishes can be prepared based on demand. For customers, à la carte is a personal experience, catering to different tastes and dietary requirements.

Imagine you’re a server at a cool Italian restaurant. A group of four friends comes in for dinner. One is vegetarian, one is gluten-free, one is on a budget and one is a foodie who wants to try everything. With your à la carte menu, you can cater to everyone’s needs. The vegetarian can have a caprese salad and mushroom risotto, the gluten-free guest can have grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, the budget-conscious diner can have a margherita pizza, and the foodie can have antipasti, pasta and osso buco. By offering à la carte options, you’ve ensured each guest can have a meal tailored to their own preferences.
