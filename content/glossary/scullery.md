A scullery is a small room or area in a kitchen where you wash dishes, utensils and other kitchen equipment. It's separate from the main cooking area and usually has sinks, dishwashers and storage for cleaning products. The word comes from the Latin 'scutella' meaning tray or platter.

In hospitality a scullery is crucial for maintaining hygiene standards and smooth kitchen operation. It keeps the main kitchen area clean and tidy so chefs and cooks can focus on food prep without interruptions. A well designed scullery can increase efficiency, reduce cross contamination risks and contribute to a more streamlined workflow in busy restaurant or hotel kitchens.

You're the head chef at a busy beachside restaurant in peak season. The kitchen is chaotic with orders coming in thick and fast. You look over and the dish pit is overflowing and dirty pots and pans are mounting up. You call out to your sous chef, 'Can you send someone to the scullery to clear this backlog? We need clean pans for the next batch of orders!' This simple request keeps the kitchen in rhythm and allows your team to keep serving the guests without delays.
