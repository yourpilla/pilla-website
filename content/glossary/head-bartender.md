A Head Bartender is the top bartender in a bar or restaurant, responsible for the overall running of the bar, staff and service. They create cocktail menus, train other bartenders, manage inventory and ensure service standards are met. Head Bartenders have years of experience and knowledge of mixology, spirits and customer service.

The Head Bartender role is key in hospitality as it's directly attached to the venue's reputation and profitability. They set the tone for the bar, create signature drinks that can be a draw for customers and manage costs through inventory control. Their skills in cocktail making and service can make a huge difference to the guest experience and lead to good reviews and repeat business.

Imagine this: You're the Head Bartender at a new cocktail bar in London. It's Friday night and the bar is rammed. A VIP walks in and requests a bespoke cocktail. You delegate tasks to your team to keep the other guests served, and using your years of knowledge, you create a drink tailored to the VIP's tastes and impress both the guest and your manager. Later, you notice the bar is running low on a key ingredient. You adjust the cocktail menu to feature drinks that don't require that ingredient and avoid any service disruption. This is how a Head Bartender uses their leadership, creativity and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced hospitality environment.'
