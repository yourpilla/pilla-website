A high top is a tall table used in bars, cafes and casual dining areas. These tables are higher than a standard dining table and are paired with bar stools or tall chairs. High tops are designed for comfort while standing or perching on a stool, perfect for quick meals, drinks or casual chats.

High tops are a key part of hospitality by maximising space and creating a versatile dining area. They allow more people to be seated in a smaller space as they take up less floor space than a standard table. High tops also create a more relaxed social atmosphere, encouraging people to mingle and chat. This is especially useful during busy periods or events where you need to be able to move people around and change seating arrangements.

Imagine you’re managing a popular sports bar on a busy Saturday night. The big game is about to kick off and you’re expecting a full house. You’ve placed high tops near the bar and around the perimeter of the room. As customers arrive you can seat them at these tables and they can stand or sit and enjoy their drinks and bar snacks. The high tops allow you to fit more people in the space without overcrowding and their casual nature encourages people to move around, socialise and cheer on their team. By the end of the night you’ve maximised your revenue and given your customers a great experience, all thanks to your clever use of high tops in your layout.'
