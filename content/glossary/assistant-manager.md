Imagine you're an Assistant Manager in a busy restaurant. It's Friday night and one of your servers has phoned in sick. You quickly assess the situation, re-allocate tables to the staff you have and step in to help with service during the peak. Later a customer complains about a dish. You listen, apologise and offer to replace the meal for free. After the rush you brief the head chef about the complaint and discuss how to prevent it happening again. Throughout the night you've shown the many hats of an Assistant Manager - problem solving, staff management, customer service and operational improvement all in one shift.'
