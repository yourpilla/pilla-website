Barware is the tools, equipment and utensils used in bars, pubs and restaurants to prepare, serve and consume drinks. This includes things like shakers, strainers, jiggers, muddlers, bar spoons, glassware, ice buckets and bottle openers. Barware also includes decorative items like cocktail picks, stirrers and garnish tools that add to the presentation of drinks.

The right barware is essential for any business that serves drinks. It allows bartenders to make drinks quickly and consistently so every cocktail meets the expected standard. Proper barware also enhances the drinking experience for the customer as it adds to the visual and presentation of the drink. For example, using the right glassware can affect the aroma, temperature and even the taste of the drink. And well maintained and looking good barware reflects well on your establishment, ensuring customers are impressed with the service provided.

Say you're a bar manager at a cocktail bar. You notice your bartenders are struggling to keep up during busy periods. You take a closer look and see they're wasting time searching for the right tools. You decide to reorganise the bar so each station has everything they need. You invest in good quality shakers, jiggers and strainers and create a standard layout for easy access. The result? Your bartenders can work more efficiently, reduce wait times and increase customer satisfaction. Plus, the barware looks sleek and professional, encouraging your customers to order more and leave positive reviews.'
