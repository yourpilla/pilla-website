Merchandising in hospitality is the strategic placement and promotion of products or services to increase sales and guest experience. This includes the layout, pricing and visual merchandising that encourages the customer to buy. Good merchandising can turn a simple display into a sales tool, whether it's pastries in a café or spa services in a hotel.

For hospitality businesses, merchandising is a way to increase revenue and guest satisfaction. By thoughtfully placing and promoting products or services, you can grab your customer's attention and get them to spend more. Good merchandising can turn a browser into a buyer, whether it's a guest buying a souvenir from the hotel shop or a diner ordering that dessert they saw on display. It's not just about selling more, it's about the overall experience and making the guest feel they are getting value for money.

Let’s say you're running a rooftop bar and you've just launched a new signature cocktail and you want to promote it. You could use merchandising techniques like putting up eye-catching posters around the bar, train your staff to recommend it and even create a display at the bar where guests can watch the cocktail being made. You could also offer a small taster to interested guests. By the end of the week, the new cocktail is your top seller, and it's all thanks to your merchandising.'
