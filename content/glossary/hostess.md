A hostess is a hospitality professional who greets and welcomes guests as they walk in the door of a restaurant, bar or any other dining establishment. They manage the front of house, seating, reservations and coordinate with wait staff to ensure service runs smoothly. The hostess is the first point of contact for the customer and sets the tone for their dining experience.

The hostess role is key in hospitality as they set the first impression of the establishment. They manage the flow of guests, reservations and the atmosphere, which directly impacts customer satisfaction and the success of the business. A good hostess can turn a stressful situation, like a busy night with limited seating, into a positive experience for the guest.

Imagine this: You’re a hostess at a busy seafood restaurant on a Friday night. The place is jammed and there’s a line of hungry customers waiting to be seated. You see a couple celebrating their anniversary who made a reservation weeks ago. Despite the chaos, you greet them warmly, congratulate them and escort them to a special table with a harbour view. Your attention and professionalism make the couple’s night special and keep the restaurant running smoothly, highlighting the importance of a hostess in creating memorable dining experiences.'
