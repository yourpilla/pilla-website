    customers and bookings. This varies depending on location and type of
    business but generally means fewer tourists, less demand and lower prices.

Low season or off peak season is when your business has the least amount of customers and bookings. This varies depending on the location and type of business but generally means fewer tourists, less demand and lower prices. For hotels in coastal areas, low season is during the colder months and for ski resorts, it’s during the summer.

Understanding low season is important for hospitality professionals as it affects business operations and financial planning. During this time you will see a drop in occupancy and revenue. But low season also presents opportunities for maintenance, staff training and marketing strategies to attract customers. Many businesses offer discounts or special packages to entice guests during these quiet periods to keep the cash flow going and staff employed.

Let’s say you’re the manager of a boutique hotel in London. Your low season is from November to February excluding Christmas and New Year. To boost bookings you might create a ‘Winter Warmer’ package with a discounted room rate, hot chocolate and tickets to an indoor attraction nearby. You could also use this time to renovate a few rooms or train your staff on a new booking system, tasks that would be hard to do during the busy summer months. By being proactive during low season you’re setting your hotel up for success when peak season comes around again.'
