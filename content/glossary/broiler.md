A broiler is a kitchen appliance that cooks food at high heat from above. It’s often built into ovens as a separate compartment or function. Broilers can get up to 550°F (288°C) and are great for quick cooking, browning or crisping food.

Broilers are essential in hospitality as they allow chefs to make so many dishes quickly. They’re perfect for finishing off steaks with a crusty outside, melting cheese on top of dishes or toasting bread. The high heat of a broiler can also get you that Maillard reaction which gives flavour a wonderful depth and complexity.

You’re a line cook in a busy restaurant kitchen. The head chef calls out an order for a salmon fillet with crispy skin. You season the fillet and pop it skin side up under the broiler. In a few minutes the skin is golden and crispy and the inside is tender and moist. The broiler has allowed you to get the dish out quickly and keep the pace of the kitchen and get the food out to the customers efficiently.'
