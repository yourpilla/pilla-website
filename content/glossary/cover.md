In the hospitality world a 'cover' is each individual diner or guest in a restaurant or dining establishment. This is used to measure the number of people served during a specific period, e.g. lunch or dinner service. So if a restaurant serves 50 people for lunch they would say they had 50 covers for that service.

Understanding and tracking covers is crucial for any hospitality business. It helps with forecasting, staffing and inventory management. By knowing your average number of covers per service you can prepare for busy periods, have the right staff on hand and stock the right ingredients. Covers also help with calculating revenue per cover which assists with pricing and menu planning.

Imagine you’re the manager of a busy city centre cafe. It’s a sunny Saturday morning and you’re expecting a big brunch service. As you brief your team you might say, 'We’re expecting 100 covers today so let’s make sure we’re fully stocked and everyone’s on it.' This information helps your kitchen staff prepare food, your front of house team to be ready for the rush and you to have enough tableware for all your customers. By managing your covers effectively you’ll give your customers a seamless experience and maximise your cafe’s efficiency and profitability.
