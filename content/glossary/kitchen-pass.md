The kitchen pass, also known as the pass-through or just the pass, is the counter or window that separates the kitchen from the dining area in a restaurant or food service business. It's where finished dishes are put for servers to pick up and deliver to the customers. The pass may have a heated surface to keep food warm and overhead lights to illuminate the dishes.

The kitchen pass is key to a smooth running hospitality business. It's the communication hub between the kitchen and front of house staff to ensure orders are correct, plated and delivered to the right tables. The pass helps with food quality by keeping dishes at the right temperature and allowing for final checks before service. It also helps with workflow, reduces errors and overall customer satisfaction.

Imagine this: You're a sous chef in an Italian restaurant on a Friday night. Orders are flying in and you're plating up an osso buco. As you add the final garnish you call out, 'Osso buco for table 12, ready on the pass!' The head chef gives it a quick once-over then slides it onto the heated section of the pass. He then rings the bell to let the waiting staff know the dish is ready for collection. A server arrives, checks the table number and whisks the steaming plate away to the waiting customers. The kitchen pass has just facilitated another smooth handover between kitchen and dining room, and your beautiful dish is on its way to the customer.
