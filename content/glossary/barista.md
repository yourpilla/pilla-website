A barista is a trained professional who can make and serve great coffee. They know the art of coffee from bean to latte art. Baristas work in cafes, coffee shops, restaurants and hotels where they make a variety of espresso based drinks and other hot and cold drinks.

In hospitality a barista is the key to delivering a great coffee experience to the guest. They are often the first point of contact for the customer, setting the tone for their visit. A good barista can turn a simple coffee order into an experience, increasing customer satisfaction and repeat business. Their skills add value to a venue and can increase revenue and reputation.

Imagine this: You’re the head chef of a busy hotel restaurant. You’ve just launched a new breakfast menu with specialty coffees. Your new barista Sarah is put to the test on the first morning rush. As the guests start to flood in Sarah is making perfect lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites and even adding latte art to each cup. The guests are impressed, commenting on the quality and presentation of the coffee. You overhear several say they will come back just for the coffee. Sarah’s skills as a barista have not only improved the breakfast service but also created a new draw for your restaurant and potentially your hotel.'
