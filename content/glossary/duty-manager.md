Imagine this: You’re working as a bartender in a busy hotel bar on a Saturday night. A group of loud guests are causing a disturbance and making other customers uncomfortable. You call the Duty Manager who arrives quickly to assess the situation. They approach the group calmly and use their conflict resolution skills to defuse the situation. The Duty Manager then decides to ask the troublemakers to leave so other customers can feel safe and comfortable. Throughout the rest of the night the Duty Manager checks in with you and other staff to offer support and guidance to keep the service running smoothly. This scenario shows how a Duty Manager’s quick thinking and leadership can positively impact the guest experience and staff morale in a hospitality environment.'
