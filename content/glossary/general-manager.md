Imagine you’re the General Manager of a city centre hotel. It’s peak season and you’ve just been told a VIP is arriving unexpectedly. You call a team huddle, delegate tasks to get the VIP’s room ready, arrange a welcome package and brief the front desk on the special check-in process. Meanwhile, the lobby is getting busy with a tour group arrival. You jump in at reception to show the team how to handle pressure and still be welcoming. Later you meet with your department heads to review the day’s challenges and successes, always looking for ways to improve service and efficiency.
