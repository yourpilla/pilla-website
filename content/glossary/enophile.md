An enophile is someone who loves wine. This comes from the Greek words oinos meaning wine and philos meaning love. Enophiles are passionate about all things wine, including production, history and tasting. They have a deep knowledge of wine regions, grape varieties and winemaking techniques.

Knowing your enophiles is key in hospitality because these guests have high expectations when it comes to wine service and selection. They will spend more on wine and love establishments that cater to their interests. By recognising and catering to enophiles, restaurants, bars and hotels can increase their reputation, revenue and loyal customers who value a wine experience.

Let’s say you’re a sommelier at a fine dining restaurant. A group of guests arrive and one of them mentions they’re part of a wine club. You think to yourself 'Ah we’ve got an enophile here!' You’d then tailor your service, maybe recommend a rare vintage or offer a tour of the wine cellar. You might also engage them in a conversation about the wine list, sharing your knowledge about the wines’ origins and production methods. This personalised service will impress the enophile and the whole table, potentially leading to higher sales and repeat business.'
