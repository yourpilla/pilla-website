House rules are a set of rules and regulations for a hospitality venue to keep the peace, keep guests safe and protect the property. These rules outline what’s expected, what’s not allowed and what the policies are for guests to follow during their stay or visit. Common house rules are noise restrictions, smoking policies, pet allowance and check out times.

House rules are important in hospitality management. They create a pleasant environment for all guests, prevent conflicts and protect the reputation of the venue. Clear house rules also protect staff by giving them a framework to deal with issues and enforce policies consistently. By setting expectations upfront you can avoid misunderstandings and give your guests a better experience.

Let’s say you run a busy restaurant in the city centre. Your house rules might include a dress code, outside food and drink policy and guidelines for large group bookings. One evening a group of guests arrive dressed in beachwear, with takeaway coffees from another café. You explain the house rules to them, offer to store their drinks and provide menus. They appreciate your clear communication and comply with the rules and everyone has a great time in the restaurant. This scenario shows how clear house rules can help you maintain the environment you want for your venue and still provide great customer service.'
