A jigger is a little hourglass-shaped measuring tool used in bartending to pour spirits and other liquids. It has two sides, one side 1 oz (30ml) and the other side 1.5 oz (45ml). Some jiggers may have different measurements, but the principle is the same: to give bartenders a precise way to measure liquids for cocktails.

Jiggers are important in hospitality because they give consistency in drink preparation. When you use a jigger, you can make cocktails that taste the same every time, no matter who makes them. Consistency is key to quality and meeting customer expectations. Jiggers also control costs by preventing overpouring, which can eat into profits over time.

Imagine this: you’re behind the bar in a busy cocktail bar, a group of regulars come in and order their favourite martinis. They’re picky about their drinks, so you reach for your jigger. As you make each martini, you use the jigger to measure out 2.5 oz of gin and 0.5 oz of vermouth. The result? Perfect, identical martinis that keep your customers happy and coming back for more. Without your jigger, you might end up with inconsistent drinks that will disappoint your regulars and harm your bar’s reputation.'
