A cloche is a dome shaped cover used in food service to keep food warm or to make a big reveal when serving food to guests. It comes from the French word for 'bell' and can be made of silver, glass or plastic. Cloches are used in fine dining restaurants and high end room service in hotels.

Cloches are useful in hospitality because they keep food warm, protect the dish from contaminants and add theatre to the dining experience. They’re particularly useful for room service in hotels where food may travel a distance before it reaches the guest. The reveal of lifting a cloche can turn a simple meal into a memorable moment for the diner.

Imagine you’re working room service in a luxury hotel. A VIP guest orders a gourmet breakfast in bed. You place the hot items under a silver cloche and the cold items on the same tray but uncovered. When you get to the guest’s room you present the tray and lift the cloche with a big reveal, the aroma of freshly cooked food fills the air. The guest is wowed by the presentation and the temperature of their meal. That little touch of using a cloche has turned a standard breakfast into a 5 star experience.'
