A busser is a staff member in a restaurant or cafe who clears and cleans tables, restocks supplies and helps the waitstaff. Their main jobs are to take away dirty dishes, wipe down tables, reset tables and keep the dining area clean. Bussers work closely with servers and kitchen staff to keep things running smoothly and tables turning.

Bussers are key to the efficiency and cleanliness of a restaurant. They help create a great dining experience by having tables clean and ready for the next customers so servers can focus on taking orders and serving. Bussers also contribute to the overall hygiene and look of the restaurant which directly affects customer satisfaction and the reputation of the establishment.

Imagine this: You’re the head waiter at a busy Italian restaurant on a Friday night. The dining room is full and you notice a family of four have just finished their meal. You catch the eye of your busser Maria and give her a little nod towards the table. Within seconds Maria is at the table, clears the dirty dishes, wipes down the surface and replaces the tablecloth. She then resets the table with fresh cutlery, napkins and glasses. Thanks to Maria’s quick work you can seat the next customers within minutes and keep the service flowing and maximise the restaurant’s turnover for the night.'
