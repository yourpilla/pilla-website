    Entrée is a hospitality term for the main course of a meal. In British and
    Australian English it’s the main dish served during a meal, after the
    starter or appetiser. But in American English entrée means the starter
    itself, which can cause confusion in international dining. The word comes
    from French meaning 'entry' or 'beginning' which explains the different
    meanings across cultures.

Entrée is a hospitality term for the main course of a meal. In British and Australian English it’s the main dish served during a meal, after the starter or appetiser. But in American English entrée means the starter itself, which can cause confusion in international dining. The word comes from French meaning 'entry' or 'beginning' which explains the different meanings across cultures.

The entrée plays a big part in menu planning and service. As the main dish it’s usually the biggest and most expensive item on the menu. Chefs spend a lot of time perfecting entrée recipes as they’re usually the hero of the meal. For restaurant owners and managers entrées are the profit drivers and can impact customer satisfaction and return visits.

Let’s say you’re a chef at a busy restaurant. You’ve just received an order for your signature entrée - a pan-seared salmon with roasted vegetables. As you call out 'Fire one salmon entrée!' to your team you’re not just calling an order. You’re starting a well-oiled machine where timing is everything. The entrée has to be ready at the perfect moment, not too early to go cold, not too late to keep the customer waiting. This is how the term entrée is more than just a menu item - it’s a part of kitchen communication and timing in the hospitality world.'
