    A French Press is a manual coffee brewing device that features a glass or
    stainless steel jug, a plunger, and a metal or nylon mesh filter. It steeps
    coarse coffee grounds in hot water before the plunger separates the brewed
    coffee from the grounds, producing a full-bodied brew with more oils and

A French Press is a manual coffee brewing device that consists of a glass or stainless steel jug, plunger and metal or nylon mesh filter. It works by steeping coarse coffee grounds in hot water for a few minutes, then pressing the plunger down to separate the brewed coffee from the grounds. This method produces a full-bodied coffee with more oils and sediment than other methods.

French Presses are important in hospitality because they offer a simple yet elegant way to serve freshly brewed coffee to your guests. They’re versatile; you can adjust the brew strength and serving size to suit your guests' preferences. French Presses also add a bit of theatre to the dining experience as your guests can watch and participate in the brewing process.

You’re a breakfast server at a boutique hotel. A guest asks for a strong coffee and you recommend the French Press. You bring the press to their table with hot water and freshly ground coffee. You explain the process and ask them to plunge the coffee after 4 minutes. This not only gives the guest a personal coffee experience but also creates a memorable moment during their stay, leading to higher satisfaction.
