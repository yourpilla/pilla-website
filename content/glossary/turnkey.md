Turnkey means a product or service that's ready to go, no work or setup required from the buyer. In hospitality, this means a fully fitted out and operational business ready to go. For example, a turnkey hotel would come with all the furniture, staff and systems in place.

This is valuable in hospitality because it allows entrepreneurs or investors to get into the market quickly without the long process of starting from scratch. A turnkey operation reduces startup time and costs and allows owners to focus on guest experience and revenue generation straight away. It's great for those new to the industry or looking to expand their portfolio quickly.

Let's say you're a successful restaurateur looking to get into the hotel business. You find a turnkey boutique hotel for sale in a great location. Upon purchase, you can start taking guests straight away because everything from the reservation system to the housekeeping staff is already in place. So you can apply your hospitality expertise to the guest experience and marketing the property rather than getting bogged down in the setup of the basics.'
