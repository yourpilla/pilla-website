Off site catering is where you prepare and serve food at a location other than your main restaurant or food service establishment. This means transporting food, equipment and staff to private homes, offices or event spaces. Off site catering allows hospitality businesses to extend their reach beyond their four walls and cater to more clients and events.

For hospitality professionals, off site catering is a way to diversify your revenue streams and showcase your culinary skills in different environments. Restaurants, hotels and catering companies can tap into the events market from weddings and birthdays to corporate functions and festivals. By offering off site catering, you can make the most of your kitchen and staff during quiet periods and increase profitability and brand awareness.

Let’s say you’re the head chef of a popular Italian restaurant. A local tech company comes to you to cater their annual company picnic for 200 employees. You would use your off site catering skills to plan a menu that travels well, transport the food and equipment and coordinate staff to serve at the outdoor venue. You might create a buffet of cold antipasti, portable wood fired pizzas and gelato for dessert. By delivering this off site catering job, you’ve not only generated extra revenue but also potentially reached 200 new customers who might visit your restaurant in the future.'
