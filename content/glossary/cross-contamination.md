Cross contamination is the transfer of harmful bacteria or other microorganisms from one food to another through direct contact or indirect contact via utensils, equipment or surfaces. This can happen when raw food comes into contact with cooked or ready to eat food or when contaminated items touch clean ones. Cross contamination is a big issue in food safety and can lead to food poisoning if not managed properly.

Preventing cross contamination is top priority in hospitality as it directly impacts guest health and safety. As hospitality professionals we have a duty of care to our guests and failing to prevent cross contamination can have serious consequences. These can be food poisoning outbreaks, damage to reputation, legal issues and potential closure of the business. By implementing strict food safety protocols and training staff on proper handling techniques we can reduce the risk of cross contamination and give our guests a safe dining experience.

Let’s say you’re working in a busy hotel kitchen during dinner service. You’re preparing a salad for a guest with a severe nut allergy. You’ve just chopped walnuts for another dish and without thinking you use the same cutting board and knife to slice tomatoes for the salad. This is cross contamination. The residual nut particles on the board and knife could transfer to the tomatoes and cause a severe allergic reaction to the guest. To avoid this you should always use separate cutting boards and utensils for different food types especially when dealing with common allergens. Clean and sanitise your workstation between tasks and wash your hands thoroughly. By being mindful of these practices you’ll maintain food safety standards and protect your guests’ health.'
