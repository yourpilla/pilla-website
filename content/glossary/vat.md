VAT is a consumption tax added to the price of goods and services. In the hospitality industry, VAT applies to most of what we sell, from room rates to food and beverage. It's collected at every stage of the production and distribution process and the consumer pays the full amount.

VAT is important in hospitality because it impacts pricing and profit margins. We need to calculate and include VAT in our pricing to stay competitive and tax compliant. Knowing VAT helps us manage our finances and follow the rules.

Let's say you're a restaurant manager launching a new menu. You price a main course at £20 which includes £3.33 VAT (20% rate). When a customer orders this dish you take the full £20. Later you'll pay £3.33 to the tax authorities. By keeping track of VAT you're charging customers correctly and setting aside the right amount for tax payments. This knowledge helps you keep your financial records accurate and avoid any tax headaches.'
