A food allergy is an immune system reaction that happens within minutes of eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy causing food can trigger digestive issues, hives or swollen airways. In some people a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even anaphylaxis. Common food allergens are peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy and wheat.

Food allergies are a big deal in the hospitality industry because they impact guest safety and satisfaction. As hospitality professionals we need to be food allergy aware to prevent life threatening reactions. Managing food allergies shows we care about our guests and can make a huge difference to those with dietary requirements.

Let’s say you’re a chef in a busy restaurant. A server tells you a guest has a severe nut allergy. You check your mise en place and see the salad dressing contains almond oil. You whip up a new nut free dressing and make sure all utensils and surfaces are clean to avoid cross contamination. You also check with the server to confirm the guest’s other menu choices for allergens. This attention to detail keeps the guest safe and shows you care, which will likely result in a happy customer who will come back and tell their friends about your restaurant.'
