# Company Reports

Company Reports are AI-powered strategic analytics designed for executives and administrators who need high-level insights across multiple sites, teams, and operational areas. Unlike manager reports that focus on individual team performance, Company Reports provide executive-level intelligence for strategic decision-making and operational oversight.

## What Are Company Reports?

Company Reports transform company-wide operational data into strategic intelligence for executives. These reports analyze performance across multiple sites, identify operational patterns, and provide insights that help leadership make informed decisions about resource allocation, operational efficiency, and strategic improvements.

Key capabilities include:

- **Multi-Site Performance Analysis**: Compare operational metrics across all company locations
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Identify company-wide trends that impact business performance
- **Dynamic Analysis Requests**: Ask specific questions in natural language and receive customized analysis
- **Executive-Level Insights**: Focus on strategic decisions rather than individual employee management
- **Operational Efficiency Metrics**: Understand how different sites, processes, and time periods perform

The system uses advanced AI to process data from across your entire operation, providing insights that would require a full analytics team to generate manually.

## How Company Reports Work

### Step 1: Executive Report Request
Company Reports are initiated through direct requests from authorized administrators via the Pilla platform. Unlike manager reports that run automatically, Company Reports are generated on-demand when executives need specific insights.

Administrators can either:
- **Request Standard Analysis**: Get comprehensive company-wide performance overview
- **Submit Custom Analysis Requests**: Ask specific questions in natural language for targeted insights

The system verifies that the requesting user has executive-level permissions before processing any company-wide data.

### Step 2: Company-Wide Data Collection
The system collects comprehensive operational data across all specified sites and date ranges:

- **Multi-Site Shift Data**: Aggregates shift records from all company locations, including scheduling, attendance, and performance metrics
- **Cross-Location Work Items**: Compiles task completion data, efficiency metrics, and operational performance across sites
- **Site-Level Focus**: Emphasizes location-based comparisons rather than individual team details
- **Date Range Flexibility**: Can analyze data from specific weeks, months, or custom time periods as requested

Data collection automatically excludes team-specific details to maintain executive-level focus on strategic insights rather than individual management concerns.

### Step 3: Intelligent Request Processing
Before analysis, the system determines what type of insights to generate based on the administrator's request:

#### Standard Analysis Path
For general company reports, the system processes data using established site-comparison algorithms:
- **Site Performance Metrics**: Calculates key operational indicators for each location
- **Comparative Analysis**: Identifies top and bottom-performing sites across various metrics  
- **Company Averages**: Establishes baseline performance indicators across the entire operation

#### Dynamic Analysis Path
For custom requests, the system uses advanced AI to interpret natural language queries:
- **Request Interpretation**: AI converts questions like "Show me clock-in performance across all sites" into structured analysis plans
- **Custom Aggregation**: Processes data according to specific executive requirements
- **Flexible Reporting**: Generates insights tailored to the exact question being asked

### Step 4: Advanced AI Analysis
The processed data is analyzed using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, specifically configured for executive-level hospitality insights:

#### Strategic Pattern Recognition
- **Cross-Site Comparisons**: Identifies which locations excel or struggle in specific operational areas
- **Operational Efficiency**: Analyzes productivity patterns, resource utilization, and operational bottlenecks
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establishes performance standards and identifies locations that exceed or fall short
- **Trend Analysis**: Recognizes company-wide patterns that impact strategic decision-making

#### Dynamic Analysis Capabilities
When processing custom requests, the AI can:
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Examine data across site, time, operational category, and performance metrics simultaneously
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Understand complex business questions and provide relevant insights
- **Comparative Intelligence**: Automatically benchmark performance against company standards or industry best practices
- **Predictive Insights**: Identify patterns that may impact future performance

### Step 5: Executive-Level Insight Generation
The AI organizes findings into executive-appropriate categories:

- **Strategic Overview**: High-level summary of company-wide performance and key findings
- **Cross-Site Performance**: Detailed comparison of how different locations perform across key metrics
- **Operational Insights**: Identification of efficiency opportunities and operational patterns
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improving company-wide performance
- **Priority Areas**: Issues that require executive attention or strategic intervention

All insights are written for executive consumption - focusing on strategic implications rather than operational details.

### Step 6: Dynamic Response Formatting
Depending on the request type, the system formats responses appropriately:

#### Standard Company Reports
- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview suitable for leadership review
- **Site Comparison Charts**: Clear performance comparisons across locations
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Company-wide metrics with site-level breakdowns
- **Strategic Recommendations**: High-level suggestions for operational improvements

#### Dynamic Analysis Reports
- **Custom Insight Sections**: Organized according to the specific questions asked
- **Flexible Data Presentation**: Charts, comparisons, and analysis tailored to the request
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Suggestions directly related to the areas being analyzed
- **Follow-up Opportunities**: Suggestions for additional analysis that might provide value

### Step 7: Personalized Executive Delivery
Each company report is personalized for the requesting administrator:

- **Individual Analysis**: Each executive receives their own AI analysis, even if multiple administrators request similar reports
- **Personalized Greeting**: Reports address the specific administrator by name
- **Company Context**: Reports include relevant company-specific context and branding
- **Executive Formatting**: Professional presentation suitable for board meetings or strategic planning sessions

### Step 8: Secure Executive Email Delivery
Company Reports are delivered via the same secure email system used for manager reports:

- **Executive Formatting**: Professional styling appropriate for leadership communication
- **High-Priority Delivery**: Optimized for executive email systems and mobile devices
- **Secure Transmission**: All company data is encrypted and delivered securely
- **Delivery Confirmation**: System tracks successful delivery and can retry if needed

Reports are typically delivered within 2-3 minutes of request, allowing executives to receive insights quickly for meetings or decision-making.

### Step 9: Strategic Action and Follow-up
Once executives receive their reports, they can:

- **Strategic Planning**: Use insights for high-level operational planning and resource allocation
- **Site Management**: Identify locations that need additional support or recognition
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish company-wide standards based on top-performing locations
- **Operational Investment**: Make data-driven decisions about where to invest resources
- **Follow-up Analysis**: Request additional custom analysis based on initial findings

## Dynamic Analysis Capabilities
