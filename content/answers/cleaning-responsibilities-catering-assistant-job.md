# How should I mention cleaning responsibilities in a Catering Assistant job description?

When writing a job description for a Catering Assistant, clearly outline the cleaning responsibilities. This helps potential candidates understand what is expected of them and ensures they are prepared for all aspects of the job. Include specific tasks like sanitising workspaces and equipment, and breaking down tables and serving areas post-service.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning duties are obvious and don't need to be detailed in the job description.**

It's important to explicitly list cleaning duties, even if they seem obvious. This avoids any confusion and sets clear expectations from the start. Detailed responsibilities help attract candidates who are willing to perform these tasks.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s sufficient to just mention 'responsible for cleaning' without specifics.**

Merely stating that the role includes cleaning is too vague and can lead to misunderstandings about the scope of the job. Specific tasks should be listed to provide clarity and help manage expectations effectively.

## Is it better to list specific cleaning tasks or general expectations?

It is better to list specific cleaning tasks in the job description. This clarity helps candidates understand exactly what their responsibilities will be and reflects the thoroughness and professionalism of your operation. For example, specify tasks like "Sanitise all workspaces and equipment used during service" and "Ensure waste disposal follows environmental guidelines or business policies".

**Common misunderstanding: General statements about cleanliness are enough to convey the job requirements.**

General statements can lead to inconsistent standards of cleanliness and misunderstandings about the extent of the job duties. Specific tasks ensure that all team members know what is expected and can perform to the required standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Listing every minor cleaning task makes the job description too detailed and overwhelming.**

While it's important not to overwhelm the candidate with minutiae, key cleaning tasks should be clearly outlined to avoid ambiguity. This helps in setting the right expectations and aids in the training process.

## What standards should I expect Catering Assistants to follow?

You should expect Catering Assistants to follow high standards of cleanliness and hygiene to ensure a safe and professional catering environment. Specify that they must adhere to health and safety regulations, maintain excellent hygiene standards at all times, and handle food safely. It's also beneficial to mention any specific standards or certifications that are relevant to your operation, like HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points).

**Common misunderstanding: Basic cleaning is all that’s required from Catering Assistants.**

Catering Assistants should do more than just basic cleaning; they need to ensure that all areas are sanitised and that hygiene practices meet industry standards to prevent foodborne illnesses. This is crucial for maintaining a safe eating environment and a professional reputation.

**Common misunderstanding: All Catering Assistants automatically know the cleaning standards expected in a professional kitchen.**

Do not assume that all candidates will have the same level of understanding or training in professional cleaning standards. Clearly outline the expected standards in the job description and provide training to ensure these standards are met consistently.
