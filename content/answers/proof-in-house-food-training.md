All training activities need to be documented using the 'Training' activity in Pilla. This creates a digital record of your training completion. For each training session, photos of written registers should be uploaded, and any certificates from external training should be added to the content section. This documentation serves as your proof of completion.

The system will also track when your training needs renewal, making it easier to stay compliant.

**Common misunderstanding: In-house food hygiene training documentation must be kept in physical form to be valid in audits.**

This is a misconception. Digital records of training documentation, such as those maintained through the Pilla system, are fully compliant with audit requirements. Digital documentation is often preferred for its ease of access, security, and ability to be updated in real-time, ensuring that records are consistently current and accessible.

**Common misunderstanding: Photos of training registers are not considered legitimate proof of training completion.**

In fact, photos of training registers, when uploaded into a recognized digital system like Pilla, serve as a valid and reliable proof of training completion. These digital records are securely stored and can be easily retrieved or verified during audits or inspections, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

## Do I need to keep paper copies of my training certificates as well?

No, you don't need to keep paper copies if you're using Pilla correctly. As long as you're uploading all certificates and training documentation to the 'Content' box within the Training activity, this digital record is sufficient proof of your training completion. The system maintains a clear record of who completed what training and when.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital copies of training certificates are not as secure as paper copies.**

This is a myth. Digital copies stored in systems like Pilla are often more secure than paper copies, as they benefit from encryption and secure cloud storage. These digital records are protected against physical damage, loss, and unauthorised access, offering a robust solution for maintaining training documentation.

**Common misunderstanding: Only paper certificates are accepted by authorities during evaluations.**

Authorities today recognise digital certificates as valid evidence of training completion. Digital records, when managed through compliant systems such as Pilla, are accepted during evaluations and audits, as they offer a reliable and efficient method to verify training credentials.

## How can I check what training I still need to complete?

Your business should maintain a [training matrix](https://yourpilla.com/blog/food-hygiene-training) that shows exactly what training each person has completed. Additionally, since all training activities in Pilla have frequency settings, the system will automatically remind you when you're due for renewal of any training. For example, if you need to renew your Level 2 Food Hygiene certificate every 3 years, Pilla will notify you when it's time to update your training.
