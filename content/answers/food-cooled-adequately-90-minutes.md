# What should I do if food isn't adequately cooled after 90 minutes?

If your food hasn't cooled to the required temperature within 90 minutes, it's important to act quickly to prevent food safety risks. Firstly, discard the food as it may not be safe for consumption. Then, review your cooling methods and consider using alternative techniques or adjusting portion sizes for future preparations.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to extend cooling time beyond 90 minutes if the food is almost at the right temperature.**

Extending the cooling time beyond 90 minutes can increase the risk of bacterial growth, even if the food is nearly at the correct temperature. The 90-minute rule is a critical safety limit that should not be exceeded.

**Common misunderstanding: If food isn’t cooled on time, placing it in a colder setting will make it safe.**

Simply placing food in a colder environment after it has failed to cool within the time limits does not reverse any bacterial growth that may have occurred. Always discard food that hasn't cooled properly to ensure safety.

## When should I consider reorganising the cooling space or facilities?

Consider reorganising your cooling space or upgrading your cooling facilities if you frequently encounter issues with foods not cooling adequately within the required time. This might involve arranging for more space, using additional or alternative cooling equipment, or reviewing the layout to improve airflow and cooling efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: More cooling equipment always solves cooling issues.**

While additional equipment can help, it's also vital to ensure that the existing setup is optimised for airflow and space usage. Simply adding more equipment without proper configuration may not solve the problem.

**Common misunderstanding: A one-time cooling failure doesn’t indicate a need for reorganisation.**

If cooling failures are rare, it might not be necessary to reorganise immediately. However, keep monitoring the situation. If cooling issues become more frequent, it’s time to reassess your cooling setup and procedures.

## How can I ensure staff adhere to safety points for cooling hot food?

To ensure that staff follow the correct procedures for cooling hot food, provide regular training and clear, accessible guidelines. Supervise the cooling process closely and retrain staff if necessary. Make sure everyone understands the importance of following these safety points to prevent foodborne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: Once trained, staff will always remember and follow cooling procedures.**

Staff may need reminders or updates, especially if procedures change or if they are handling unusual volumes or types of food. Regular refresher training helps maintain high standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Supervision is only necessary for new staff.**

Even experienced staff can benefit from occasional supervision to ensure that safety standards are consistently met. This also helps in identifying any new issues or misunderstandings about the cooling process.
