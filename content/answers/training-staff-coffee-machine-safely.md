  Staff using coffee machines should undergo comprehensive training for safe and
  competent operation.
---
Staff who use coffee machines in your business should receive comprehensive training to ensure they can operate the equipment safely and competently. This training should cover daily startup and shutdown procedures, safe operation of the steam wand, proper cleaning techniques, and fault reporting. Additionally, staff should be trained on emergency procedures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: Training can be informal and passed on from one employee to another.**

While informal training methods may seem convenient, they often lead to inconsistencies and gaps in knowledge. Formal training sessions ensure that all operators have the same level of understanding and competence, which is crucial for safety and compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: Once trained, staff do not need refresher courses.**

Regular refresher training is essential, even for experienced staff. It helps reinforce safe practices and updates the team on any new procedures or equipment changes.

## How do I prove that baristas are trained to use the coffee machine?

To prove that baristas are trained, you should keep detailed records of all training sessions. These records should include dates, the content covered, and the names of attendees. Additionally, it's beneficial to have a signed acknowledgment from each staff member stating that they have received and understood the training. Keeping digital records or a training log in a system like Pilla can help streamline this process and provide easy access during inspections or audits.

**Common misunderstanding: A verbal confirmation from staff is enough to prove training.**

Verbal confirmations are not verifiable and won't hold up during a formal audit or inspection. Written records are essential for proving compliance and safety practices.

**Common misunderstanding: Training records are only necessary for new staff.**

All staff, including those who have been in the role for a long time, should have up-to-date training records. This includes records of initial training as well as any subsequent refresher courses.

## Do I need to train all staff on coffee machine safety?

Not all staff need to be trained on coffee machine safety, but anyone who operates the coffee machine or has the potential to use it should receive appropriate training. This includes full-time baristas, supervisors, and any other staff who might use the machine occasionally. It's crucial to clearly define who is authorised to use the coffee machine and ensure they have received proper training.

**Common misunderstanding: Only full-time staff require training on coffee machine safety.**

Part-time and temporary staff who use the coffee machine also need full training. Safety is paramount, regardless of how many hours someone works.

**Common misunderstanding: Managers and supervisors do not need detailed training if they are not regularly using the machine.**

Managers and supervisors should also be trained, not only to cover shifts if necessary but to ensure they can oversee and enforce safety protocols effectively.
