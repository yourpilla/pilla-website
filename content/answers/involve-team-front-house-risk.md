  responsibilities.
---
Getting your team involved in the front of house (FOH) risk assessment is crucial for identifying real-world risks and ensuring everyone understands their role in maintaining safety. Start by inviting team members to walk through the FOH area during different service times, encouraging them to share observations and experiences of potential hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: Only managers need to be involved in the risk assessment process.**

Actually, involving all levels of staff, especially those who work daily in the FOH, is essential. They can provide valuable insights into daily operations and potential risks that managers might overlook.

**Common misunderstanding: A risk assessment is just a one-time activity.**

Risk assessments should be ongoing and updated regularly. Engaging your team continuously helps keep the assessment relevant and up-to-date, adapting to changes in the environment or operations.

## What insights can senior floor staff offer about FOH safety?

Senior floor staff often have years of experience and a deep understanding of the dynamics and flow of the restaurant during service. They can identify frequent trouble spots, such as areas prone to spills or customer congestion, and suggest practical solutions based on past incidents and near-misses.

**Common misunderstanding: Senior staff insights are only about preventing major accidents.**

While preventing major accidents is crucial, senior staff can also help improve overall operational efficiency and minor safety improvements that significantly enhance daily service safety.

**Common misunderstanding: The insights from senior staff are too anecdotal to be useful.**

On the contrary, the real-life experiences of senior staff are invaluable. They provide a practical perspective that can make risk assessments more relevant and effective.

## How do I get my FOH team to engage with risk management?

Engagement starts with communication. Regularly discuss the importance of safety and risk management during team meetings. Make it a part of daily operations rather than a separate, occasional activity. Encourage open dialogue about safety concerns and suggestions for improvement.

**Common misunderstanding: Staff will automatically follow safety protocols once they are trained.**

Training is just the beginning. Continuous engagement, feedback, and reinforcement of safety practices are necessary to ensure ongoing compliance and awareness.

**Common misunderstanding: Risk management is the sole responsibility of the management team.**

Risk management is a team effort. Every member of the FOH staff plays a vital role in identifying risks and implementing safety measures. Their active participation is crucial for effective risk management.
