# What should I do if I notice the fridge seal is damaged?

A damaged fridge seal needs immediate attention as it can let warm air in and cause temperature fluctuations. You should arrange to have it replaced as soon as possible. In the meantime, monitor the fridge temperature more frequently as the faulty seal could be affecting the unit's ability to maintain the correct temperature.

Remember that door seals should be part of your weekly inspection routine along with condensers and vents to ensure everything is working efficiently.

**Common misunderstanding: A small tear in the fridge seal won't affect the fridge's performance significantly.**

Even a small tear in the fridge seal can lead to significant energy loss and temperature fluctuations, compromising food safety and increasing energy costs. It's crucial to address any seal damage immediately to maintain optimal fridge performance and energy efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: Using tape to temporarily fix a fridge seal is an effective solution.**

While tape might seem like a quick fix, it doesn't provide an airtight seal and can lead to air leaks, causing the fridge to work harder to maintain its temperature. It's best to replace the seal promptly to ensure proper functioning and energy efficiency.

## Should I move the food to another fridge while waiting for the seal to be fixed?

If you notice the fridge temperature rising above 5°C due to the damaged seal, you should start monitoring the food temperature closely. If temperatures reach above 8°C, you'll need to transfer the food to another working fridge. Keep checking temperatures regularly and document all your actions in Pilla using the comments section on a fridge temperature task.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the fridge door is closed, the temperature won't rise significantly even with a damaged seal.**

A damaged seal can allow warm air to enter even with the door closed, leading to temperature rises that can jeopardise food safety. Continuous monitoring and timely relocation of food are essential to prevent spoilage.

**Common misunderstanding: Moving food to another fridge isn't necessary if the temperature is only slightly above 5°C.**

Even a slight rise in temperature can accelerate bacterial growth. To ensure food safety, it's prudent to relocate foods if the temperature exceeds safe limits, ensuring they remain below 8°C to prevent spoilage and health risks.

## How can I prevent seal damage in the future?

Regular weekly inspections of the door seal, condensers, and vents are essential to catch any issues early. Make sure the door is always closed properly and avoid overloading the fridge as this can put extra strain on the seal. Clean the seal regularly to prevent debris buildup which can cause damage over time.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning the seal once a year is sufficient to prevent damage.**

Regular cleaning is crucial to prevent debris buildup that can compromise the seal's integrity. It's advisable to clean the seal more frequently, ideally as part of a weekly maintenance routine, to ensure a tight seal and prevent long-term damage.

**Common misunderstanding: Overloading the fridge doesn't impact the door seal.**

Overloading can cause the fridge door to not close properly, putting undue stress on the seal and potentially causing damage. Ensuring proper load distribution helps maintain seal integrity and optimises fridge performance.
