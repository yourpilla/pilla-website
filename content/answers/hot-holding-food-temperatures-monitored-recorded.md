# How should hot holding food temperatures be monitored and recorded?

To ensure food safety, it's important to regularly monitor and record the temperatures of hot held foods. Use a calibrated food thermometer to check the temperature. Record these temperatures at regular intervals to ensure they remain above the minimum required level.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the temperature of hot held food once a day is enough.**

Checking temperatures just once a day isn't sufficient. Temperatures can fluctuate, and food might fall into the danger zone (between 5°C and 63°C), where bacteria can grow quickly. Regular checks help prevent this.

**Common misunderstanding: Any thermometer can be used for checking food temperature.**

Not all thermometers are suitable for checking food temperature. Always use a food-grade thermometer that provides accurate readings to ensure food safety.

## How many temperature checks should be done each day?

Temperature checks should be done at least every two hours to ensure that hot held food remains above the safe temperature threshold. This frequency can be increased during peak times or if the holding equipment is known to have fluctuating temperature levels.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to reduce the frequency of temperature checks during slow periods.**

Even during slow periods, temperature fluctuations can occur, so it’s important to maintain regular checks to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: More frequent checks are unnecessary if the food was cooked to the right temperature initially.**

Even if food is cooked to the correct temperature, holding temperatures can drop or fluctuate, leading to potential food safety risks. Regular monitoring is crucial regardless of initial cooking temperatures.

## What information must be recorded about hot held food?

For each batch of hot held food, record the type of food, the time it was placed in holding, and the temperatures at regular intervals. Also, note the time the food is removed from holding and any corrective actions taken if temperatures fall below safe levels.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording the temperature once when the food is first put on hold is enough.**

Initial temperature recording is important, but continuous monitoring and recording are necessary to ensure the food remains safe for consumption throughout the holding period.

**Common misunderstanding: Details about corrective actions are not necessary to record.**

If the temperature drops below the safe level, recording the corrective actions taken is crucial for food safety audits and ensures compliance with food safety regulations.
