# How do I tailor interview questions for different café styles?

When interviewing baristas, it's crucial to ask questions that reflect the specific style and pace of your café. This means focusing on the real-world challenges they'll face in your environment. For example, if your café is fast-paced, ask about their ability to handle high volumes of orders quickly. If it's more artisan or focused on customer interaction, inquire about their knowledge of coffee and their ability to engage with customers.

**Common misunderstanding: All barista interviews should focus solely on coffee-making skills.**

While coffee-making skills are important, the best interview questions also explore customer service, teamwork, and adaptability. Tailor your questions to uncover how well candidates can handle the specific challenges they'll face in your café's environment.

**Common misunderstanding: The same set of questions will work for any café.**

Different café styles require different skills and attitudes. What works in a fast-paced takeaway might not be suitable for a relaxed, artisan coffee shop. Always consider your café's unique style and customer base when preparing interview questions.

## What should I ask in a fast-paced or artisan coffee barista interview?

In a fast-paced café, focus on the candidate's ability to manage high volumes of orders efficiently without sacrificing quality. Questions could include scenarios about handling rush hours, multitasking, and maintaining cleanliness. For an artisan café, delve into their knowledge of coffee, their ability to educate customers about different brews, and their attention to detail in crafting drinks.

**Common misunderstanding: Speed is all that matters in a fast-paced café.**

While speed is crucial, you also need to ensure the candidate can maintain drink quality and customer service under pressure. Balance questions about speed with those about quality control and customer interaction.

**Common misunderstanding: Artisan cafés only need baristas with extensive coffee knowledge.**

Knowledge is key, but so is the ability to connect with customers and share that knowledge in an engaging way. Make sure your questions also assess communication skills and customer service.

## How do I adapt questions for hotel or restaurant Barista roles?

For hotel or restaurant settings, tailor your questions to assess not only coffee-making skills but also the ability to provide high-quality service in a more formal or diverse environment. Ask about their experience with varied customer needs, their ability to work with other departments, and their understanding of service etiquette.

**Common misunderstanding: Baristas in hotels and restaurants just need to make good coffee.**

While coffee quality is important, baristas in these settings also need to excel in customer interaction, often at a more formal level. They must be adept at handling a wide range of customer requests and maintaining poise under pressure.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience in any café setting qualifies a barista for hotel or restaurant roles.**

Not necessarily. Working in a hotel or restaurant can require a different set of service skills and etiquette. It's important to assess their experience and comfort level with the specific demands of these environments.
