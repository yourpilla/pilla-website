# How do I describe the service style when writing a Concierge job description?

When writing a job description for a Concierge, start by clearly describing the service style of your hotel. This helps potential hires understand the type of customer interaction and environment they'll be working in. For example, mention if your hotel offers a luxury, personalised service or a fast-paced, high-volume guest interaction. This sets clear expectations and attracts candidates who are a good fit for your service style.

**Common misunderstanding: A detailed service style description isn't necessary if the hotel brand is well-known.**

Even well-known brands need to specify their service style because each location might offer a different guest experience. Detailing this helps align candidate expectations from the start.

**Common misunderstanding: All luxury hotels have the same service style.**

Service styles can vary significantly even within the same category of luxury. Some might focus on high-tech, modern interactions, while others prioritise traditional, personalised guest services. Clarifying this helps find the right match for your team.

## What specific aspects make my venue appealing for potential hires?

Highlight unique aspects of your venue that might attract potential hires. This could include your commitment to sustainability, opportunities for career advancement, or special staff benefits like wellness programs. Mentioning these unique selling points makes your job offer more attractive and helps you stand out from other employers.

**Common misunderstanding: Standard benefits are enough to attract candidates.**

While standard benefits are important, highlighting unique aspects like team culture or special training programs can significantly enhance the appeal of your venue.

**Common misunderstanding: High salary is the only aspect that attracts top talent.**

Many candidates also value a positive work environment, work-life balance, and personal development opportunities, which can be just as important as the salary offered.

## Why is it important to define the type of hotel in the job description?

Defining the type of hotel in the job description is crucial as it helps potential hires understand the setting they'll be working in. Whether it's a boutique hotel, a family resort, or a luxury city hotel, each type has different guest expectations and operational styles. This information helps candidates assess if their skills and experience are a good match for your hotel.

**Common misunderstanding: The location of the hotel is enough to convey its type.**

Location doesn't always provide complete insight into the hotel's operation and guest demographics. Detailed descriptions help clarify any assumptions.

**Common misunderstanding: Experienced candidates will understand the type of hotel from the brand alone.**

Brands often operate different types of hotels under the same name, so specifying the type helps avoid confusion and ensures you attract the right candidates.
