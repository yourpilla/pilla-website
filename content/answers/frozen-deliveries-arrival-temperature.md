# What temperature should frozen deliveries be when they arrive?

Frozen foods need to be delivered at -18°C or slightly colder. You can accept deliveries up to a maximum temperature of -15°C, but anything warmer than this must be rejected as spoilage organisms may start growing and affect product quality.

It's important to check temperatures between packs using a clean, sanitised probe - never pierce the packaging itself.

**Common misunderstanding: Frozen foods can be safely delivered even if the temperature is slightly above -15°C as long as they feel cold to the touch.**

Feeling cold to the touch does not guarantee that the internal temperature of frozen foods is safe. Temperatures above -15°C can allow spoilage organisms to start growing, which can significantly affect food safety and quality. It is crucial to measure temperatures accurately using a sanitised probe between packs to ensure compliance with safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: If the delivery truck is equipped with a freezer, you don't need to check the temperature of the delivered goods.**

Even if a delivery truck is equipped with a freezer, it's important to check the temperature of the delivered goods upon arrival. Equipment malfunctions or incorrect settings can lead to temperature fluctuations, potentially compromising the safety and quality of the frozen foods. Always verify with a sanitised probe to ensure each delivery meets the required standards.

## What if I notice some items are partially defrosted?

You should reject any partially defrosted frozen goods. When these items are refrozen, they can develop freezer burn which will negatively impact the quality of the food. Make sure to clearly label rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them separately while arranging return to the supplier.

**Common misunderstanding: Partially defrosted items can be refrozen safely without any impact on food quality.**

Refreezing partially defrosted items can lead to freezer burn, which causes changes in texture and flavour, making the food less palatable and potentially unsafe. The process of thawing and refreezing can also lead to the growth of harmful bacteria, further compromising food safety. It's best to reject and replace partially defrosted items.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the core of the frozen item remains solid, partial defrosting of the outer layers is not an issue.**

Partial defrosting, even if the core is still solid, can begin to alter the food's quality by allowing bacterial growth in the thawed areas and increasing the risk of freezer burn once refrozen. Consistency in temperature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of frozen foods, so any signs of defrosting should be taken seriously.

## How quickly do I need to get frozen deliveries into storage?

You should aim to transfer frozen deliveries from the delivery point to proper storage within 15 minutes of arrival, including any unboxing time. In exceptional circumstances, you have a maximum of 30 minutes - but remember that chilled items should be prioritised first, then frozen goods, followed by ambient/dry goods.

**Common misunderstanding: It's acceptable to leave frozen deliveries at room temperature for extended periods if the items are well-packaged.**

Even well-packaged frozen items can begin to thaw if left at room temperature for too long, leading to potential quality and safety issues. It is crucial to transfer frozen deliveries to proper storage within 15 minutes to maintain the necessary temperature and prevent spoilage or bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: Chilled and frozen goods can be handled together without any specific order in terms of priority.**

Chilled items should always be prioritised over frozen goods because they are more susceptible to temperature changes. After handling chilled items, frozen goods should be promptly stored to maintain their quality. Handling them in the correct order ensures that each type of perishable item is stored under optimal conditions as quickly as possible.
