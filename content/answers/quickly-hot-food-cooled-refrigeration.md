---
Hot food must be cooled to a temperature suitable for refrigeration within 90 minutes of cooking. This rapid cooling is crucial to prevent the growth of bacteria and ensure food safety. Using methods like spreading food out to increase surface area or using a blast chiller can help achieve this efficiently.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to leave food to cool at room temperature for a few hours before refrigerating.**

Leaving hot food out for several hours can be unsafe. Bacteria can grow quickly at room temperature. Always aim to cool food to below 20°C within 90 minutes before refrigerating.

**Common misunderstanding: If the food feels cool to the touch, it's safe to refrigerate.**

Feeling food to determine its temperature isn't reliable. Use a food thermometer to ensure it has reached a safe temperature before refrigeration.

## What are the legal cooling time limits for exceptional circumstances?

Under normal circumstances, food should be cooled within 90 minutes. However, the law allows an extra 30 minutes, making it a total of 120 minutes for exceptional circumstances. This is the absolute limit and should not be exceeded to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: You can regularly extend cooling times if your kitchen is busy.**

The extra 30 minutes is only for exceptional circumstances and not meant for regular practice. Regularly exceeding 90 minutes can risk food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Any delay within the 120 minutes is acceptable without consequence.**

Even within the extended time, the quicker you cool the food, the safer it is. Always aim for the shortest possible cooling time.

## What should I do if hot food like poultry isn't cooling adequately within safe time limits?

If poultry or any large food items aren't cooling within the 90-minute window, consider reviewing your food ordering specifications. Foods that are too large may need to be portioned into smaller sizes to cool effectively. Additionally, reorganising your cooling space or arranging for extra cooling facilities might be necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: Cutting food into smaller pieces compromises its quality.**

Properly handled, cutting food into smaller pieces can actually help maintain quality by ensuring it cools uniformly and quickly, reducing the risk of bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: Using additional cooling equipment is unnecessary if you have a walk-in fridge.**

Even with a walk-in fridge, the arrangement of food and its size can impede adequate cooling. Additional equipment like blast chillers can significantly enhance cooling efficiency.
