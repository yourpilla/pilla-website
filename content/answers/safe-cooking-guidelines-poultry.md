# What are the safe cooking guidelines for poultry?

To ensure poultry is safe to eat, it must be cooked thoroughly. Poultry, including chicken, turkey, and other game birds, should reach an internal temperature of at least 75°C (167°F). This high temperature kills harmful bacteria like Campylobacter Jejuni and Salmonella, which can cause serious food poisoning. Always use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: If the meat looks white, it's cooked enough.**

Colour alone isn't a reliable indicator of safety. Poultry can turn white before it has reached a safe internal temperature. Always use a thermometer to check.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking at a high temperature for a short time is enough.**

It's important to maintain the right temperature for a sufficient time. This ensures the heat penetrates all parts of the poultry, especially near bones where bacteria can survive lower temperatures.

## What temperature must poultry reach to be safe?

Poultry must reach a minimum internal temperature of 75°C (167°F) to ensure it is safe to eat. This temperature must be held for a sufficient time to kill off harmful bacteria. Use a food thermometer to accurately measure the internal temperature of the thickest part of the bird, avoiding bones.

**Common misunderstanding: All parts of the poultry need to reach the same temperature.**

Focus on the thickest parts of the poultry, as these are the last to reach the required temperature. Even if thinner parts appear done, the thicker sections might still need more cooking.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the desired temperature is reached quickly, the food is safe.**

Reaching the correct temperature quickly doesn't always mean the poultry is safe. It's crucial to maintain this temperature for a sufficient duration to ensure all bacteria are killed.

## How can I prevent cross-contamination when handling raw poultry?

To prevent cross-contamination, always wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces after they come into contact with raw poultry. Use separate cutting boards for raw poultry and other foods. Ensure that juices from raw poultry do not drip onto other food items or cooking surfaces.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to rinse raw poultry before cooking.**

Rinsing raw poultry can actually spread bacteria around your kitchen through water splashes. Avoid washing raw poultry; cooking it to the right temperature is sufficient to kill any bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Using the same cutting board for different foods if washed between uses is safe.**

Even with washing, bacteria can reside in grooves created by cutting. It’s safer to use separate cutting boards for raw poultry and other foods to avoid any risk of cross-contamination.
