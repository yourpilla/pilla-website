Your Level 2 food hygiene certificate needs to be renewed every 3 years to stay valid and ensure you're up to date with current food safety standards. This applies to all staff who regularly handle open and high-risk foods.

While you can complete this training online, many businesses prefer in-person training as it often provides a more comprehensive learning experience with direct instructor interaction.

**Common misunderstanding: Once you have passed the Level 2 food safety certification, there's no need to renew it as long as you stay in the same job.**

The Level 2 food safety certificate must be renewed every 3 years, regardless of your job tenure or position. Food safety standards and regulations are frequently updated, and renewal ensures that certificate holders remain informed and compliant with current practices.

## Does this apply to all food hygiene certificates?

Different levels have different requirements. Level 1 certificates also need renewal every 3 years. However, Level 4 certificates don't require formal renewal, though continuous professional development (CPD) is expected to keep up with industry standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Higher-level food hygiene certificates, like Level 4, are valid indefinitely and don't require any further action post-certification.**

While Level 4 certificates do not require formal renewal, ongoing professional development is crucial. Food safety regulations are dynamic, and continuous professional development ensures that holders of advanced certifications stay knowledgeable about the latest best practices and legal requirements.

**Common misunderstanding: Food hygiene certificates are transferable between countries without any additional training or certification.**

Food hygiene regulations can vary significantly between countries. While a certificate may demonstrate a level of knowledge, you may still need to undergo additional training or certification to comply with local laws and standards in a new country.

## How do I keep track of when my certificate needs renewal?

The best way to track your certificate renewal dates is to record all training information in Pilla's Training activity. You can set up automatic reminders by setting the 'Frequency' when you add the training. This way, you'll be notified when your certificate is due for renewal. Make sure to upload your certificates to the 'Content' box for easy reference.

**Common misunderstanding: Keeping track of certificate renewals is a manual process and often leads to missed deadlines.**

Modern SaaS solutions like Pilla offer automated tracking and reminders for certificate renewals, ensuring you never miss a deadline. By utilising these tools, you can efficiently manage your certifications without the hassle of manual record-keeping.
