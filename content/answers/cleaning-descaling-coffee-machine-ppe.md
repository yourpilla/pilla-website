# What PPE is needed when cleaning or descaling a coffee machine?

When cleaning or descaling your coffee machine, wearing the right Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is crucial to protect against chemical burns and scalds. Typically, you should wear heat-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and aprons. These items protect your skin and eyes from chemical splashes and hot water.

**Common misunderstanding: Regular kitchen gloves are sufficient for descaling.**

Kitchen gloves are not designed to handle harsh chemicals or extreme temperatures. Use chemical-resistant gloves specifically designed for handling cleaning chemicals.

**Common misunderstanding: PPE is optional if you're experienced.**

No matter how experienced you are, accidents can happen, especially with chemicals and hot equipment. Always wear the recommended PPE to reduce the risk of injury.

## What are the safety risks when cleaning a coffee machine?

Cleaning a coffee machine involves several safety risks, including chemical burns from descaling agents, scalds from hot water or steam, and electrical hazards if the machine is not properly isolated from power sources. Ensuring that the machine is turned off and unplugged before starting any cleaning process is essential to prevent accidents.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to clean the machine right after use.**

Always allow the machine to cool down before starting the cleaning process to avoid burns from residual heat.

**Common misunderstanding: All cleaning agents are safe to use on coffee machines.**

Some cleaning agents can be highly corrosive or abrasive. Always use products specifically designed for coffee machines to avoid damaging the machine and exposing yourself to harmful chemicals.

## Do I need COSHH training for cleaning espresso machines?

Yes, COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) training is recommended if you are involved in cleaning espresso machines, particularly when using chemical descaling agents. This training helps you understand the risks associated with hazardous substances and how to handle them safely.

**Common misunderstanding: COSHH training is only for industrial settings.**

COSHH applies to any environment where hazardous substances are used, including hospitality settings like cafes and restaurants where cleaning chemicals are used.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick briefing is enough for handling cleaning chemicals.**

While briefings are helpful, formal COSHH training provides comprehensive knowledge and safety practices essential for handling chemicals safely and effectively.
