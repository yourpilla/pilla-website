Keeping accurate records is a key part of any HACCP plan. These records help prove that your food safety processes are effective and that you're complying with safety standards. You'll need to document everything from your hazard analysis to the monitoring of critical control points and any corrective actions taken.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the results of monitoring need to be recorded.**

It's not just about recording the outcomes. You also need to document the process, including how you monitor and why you chose specific critical limits. This comprehensive approach helps in audits and ensures that your system is functioning as intended.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital records aren't as valid as paper records.**

Whether digital or paper, all records are valid as long as they accurately reflect your HACCP activities and are accessible for inspections. In fact, digital records can be more secure and easier to manage and retrieve when needed.

## How do HACCP documentation and food safety management systems link?

Your HACCP documentation should be a core component of your food safety management system. It provides the detailed evidence needed to show that you are actively managing food safety risks based on the seven principles of HACCP. This documentation outlines how hazards are controlled at each critical control point in your process.

**Common misunderstanding: A food safety management system is the same as a HACCP plan.**

A food safety management system is broader, encompassing all daily procedures and practices to manage food safety, while a HACCP plan is focused specifically on critical control points and hazard management.

**Common misunderstanding: Once set up, HACCP documentation doesn't need to be integrated into daily operations.**

Integrating HACCP documentation into daily operations is essential. It ensures that food safety controls remain effective and are consistently applied, making it a living document that evolves with your operations.

## What should be included in HACCP validation records?

HACCP validation records should include evidence that your HACCP plan is scientifically and technically sound, that your controls effectively manage food safety hazards, and that your team is following the prescribed procedures correctly. This includes data from tests, monitoring results, and verification activities that confirm your HACCP plan is functioning as expected.

**Common misunderstanding: Validation is only about initial setup.**

Validation is an ongoing process. Regular reviews and updates to your HACCP plan based on new information, changes in processes, or after incidents are crucial to maintain its effectiveness.

**Common misunderstanding: Validation records are the same as monitoring records.**

While monitoring records track the day-to-day adherence to critical limits, validation records prove that your HACCP system is capable of controlling hazards effectively. They are about the efficacy of the system itself, not just compliance.
