# What checks should be done in guest toilets before opening?

Before your restaurant opens, it's important to ensure the toilets are clean, well-stocked, and fully functional. Start by cleaning and disinfecting all surfaces, including toilets, sinks, and countertops. Restock toilet paper, soap, and paper towels, and make sure all fixtures like taps and flushes are working. Lastly, check for any unpleasant odours or leaks, and ensure the space is well-ventilated.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick visual check is enough for toilet readiness.**

A thorough cleaning and functional check are necessary, not just a visual overview. This means actively checking that all dispensers are filled and everything is in perfect working order, not just looking clean.

**Common misunderstanding: If it was clean at closing, it's fine for opening.**

Conditions can change overnight, such as odours developing or unnoticed issues like leaks. A fresh check ensures everything is guest-ready.

## How do toilet conditions impact guest perception and hygiene ratings?

Guest toilets are a critical part of the customer experience. Poorly maintained toilets can lead to negative reviews and impact repeat business. They also play a significant role in hygiene ratings. Inspectors consider toilet cleanliness and maintenance as key indicators of overall hygiene standards in a venue. Ensuring that toilets are clean, smell fresh, and are well-stocked reflects positively on your establishment's commitment to quality and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Toilets don't need to be checked as often as dining areas.**

Toilets should be monitored regularly as they directly influence guest satisfaction and perceptions of your venue's cleanliness, potentially more so than other areas.

**Common misunderstanding: A clean appearance is enough to ensure good hygiene ratings.**

Hygiene ratings also consider the availability of supplies like soap and paper towels, which contribute to overall guest hygiene and safety, not just cleanliness.

## What are the key supplies that must be available in toilets for opening?

Essential supplies for guest toilets include sufficient toilet paper, hand soap, and paper towels or working hand dryers. Also, ensure that sanitary bins are not overfilled and are clean. It's good practice to provide hand sanitiser and check that all dispensers are functioning properly. These supplies are crucial for maintaining hygiene and comfort for your guests.

**Common misunderstanding: Extra supplies can be stored directly in the toilet area for convenience.**

While backup supplies should be accessible, they need to be stored hygienically and not clutter the space, ensuring the area remains neat and inviting.

**Common misunderstanding: Replacing supplies once a day is sufficient.**

Usage can vary, and supplies may need to be replenished more frequently based on guest volume. Regular checks are necessary to maintain adequate supply levels throughout the day.
