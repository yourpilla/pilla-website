# Can I still serve food with freezer burn?

If there's only slight freezer burn, you can cut away the affected areas either before or after cooking. However, if the food is heavily affected by freezer burn, it's best to discard it for quality reasons.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burned food is unsafe to eat and should always be discarded.**

Freezer burn is not a food safety issue. It occurs due to dehydration and oxidation, which affect the quality and texture of the food but not its safety. Slightly freezer-burned food can still be consumed after trimming the affected areas, though it may not taste as good.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking freezer burned food will restore its original quality.**

Cooking will not restore the original quality of freezer burned food. The dehydration and oxidation caused by freezer burn lead to permanent changes in texture and flavour. While cooking can make it palatable, it cannot reverse these effects.

## What causes freezer burn?

Freezer burn happens when air reaches the food's surface and causes dehydration and oxidation. You'll notice it as grayish-brown leathery spots on frozen food. While it doesn't make food unsafe to eat, it can significantly impact quality.

The main cause is food not being properly sealed in air-tight packaging. When food is exposed to air in the freezer, it becomes dehydrated and oxidised, leading to these visible changes.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burn only occurs in older freezers or those with poor temperature control.**

Freezer burn can occur in any freezer, regardless of age or temperature control, if food is not properly sealed. The primary factor is exposure to air, not the freezer's age or efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burn can be prevented by simply lowering the freezer temperature.**

While maintaining a low and consistent freezer temperature is important, it does not prevent freezer burn on its own. Proper packaging to prevent air exposure is essential to avoid freezer burn, as it is primarily caused by dehydration and oxidation due to air contact.

## How can I prevent freezer burn from happening?

The key to preventing freezer burn is proper packaging. Make sure to thoroughly wrap or package food in adequate containers before freezing. For batch-cooked foods, portion them out first as this allows for quicker freezing. Always label everything with the production date and use-by date (which should be one month from freezing).

It's also important to maintain your freezer properly - keep it at -18°C or below, and regularly check seals and vents to ensure they're clean and working correctly.

**Common misunderstanding: Using vacuum-sealed bags alone completely prevents freezer burn.**

While vacuum-sealing can significantly reduce the risk of freezer burn by removing air, it's not a guaranteed solution. Proper storage, including maintaining a consistent freezer temperature and avoiding frequent temperature fluctuations, is also essential.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burn is unavoidable no matter what precautions are taken.**

Freezer burn can be effectively minimized with the right precautions. Using airtight packaging, portioning food for faster freezing, and maintaining a consistent freezer temperature are key steps. Regular checks on freezer seals and temperatures further help prevent freezer burn.
