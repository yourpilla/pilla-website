Starting a job description for a Hotel General Manager begins with understanding your hotel's unique characteristics and needs. First, outline the hotel's vibe, guest experience, and culture. Then, detail the core responsibilities, necessary skills, required experience, and desired personality traits. Finally, be clear about the salary and benefits. This structured approach helps attract the right candidates.

**Common misunderstanding: A job description should be written quickly to fill the position as soon as possible.**

Rushing through the job description can lead to unclear expectations and attracting unsuitable candidates. Take your time to detail what the role entails and the type of candidate you are looking for to ensure a good fit for your hotel.

**Common misunderstanding: The job description should be very general to attract more candidates.**

While a broader description might attract more applicants, it's important to be specific to ensure you attract qualified candidates who are a good fit for the specific needs and culture of your hotel.

## What key information should I include about the hotel's vibe in the job description?

When describing your hotel's vibe in the job description, include the type of hotel (e.g., boutique, resort, business hotel), the style of service (e.g., luxury, budget-friendly, family-oriented), and the overall atmosphere (e.g., dynamic, relaxed, innovative). This helps candidates understand the environment and culture they might be stepping into.

**Common misunderstanding: The hotel’s vibe is not as important as the responsibilities and skills required.**

The vibe of the hotel is crucial as it sets the tone for the type of guest experience and employee culture. It helps potential candidates assess if they would fit well within your hotel's environment.

**Common misunderstanding: A simple description of the hotel’s location and size is enough.**

While location and size are important, describing the vibe involves more depth about what makes your hotel unique, such as its ethos, guest demographics, and the type of service provided. This paints a clearer picture for prospective candidates.

## How do I describe my hotel’s guest experience when writing a Hotel General Manager job description?

Describing your hotel's guest experience involves detailing what makes your service unique. Focus on how your hotel meets the needs of its guests, the kind of atmosphere you provide (e.g., luxurious, comfortable, efficient), and any special services or amenities that differentiate your hotel from others. This will help candidates understand the expectations and standards they need to meet.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s enough to say that the hotel focuses on ‘excellent guest service’.**

Merely stating that you provide excellent guest service is too vague. Be specific about what ‘excellent service’ means in the context of your hotel. Does it involve personalized services, fast check-ins, or unique amenities? Specifics help candidates visualize the kind of service they need to manage.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed descriptions of guest experiences are only necessary for luxury hotels.**

Every hotel, regardless of its market segment, benefits from a clear description of the guest experience. This clarity helps potential managers understand their role in maintaining and enhancing this experience, which is crucial for any successful hotel operation.
