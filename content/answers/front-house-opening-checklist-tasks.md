When preparing your front of house for opening, it's important to cover all areas that impact guest experience and operational efficiency. Start with a walkthrough from the perspective of a guest to spot any issues. Key tasks should include cleaning and setting up outdoor areas, ensuring the entrance and host stand are welcoming and functional, preparing the dining and seating areas, checking the bar or service station, and making sure the toilets are clean and well-stocked.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick tidy-up is enough for opening.**

Simply tidying up isn't sufficient. Each area needs thorough attention to detail to ensure it meets health standards and creates a positive impression. Tasks like wiping down menus, polishing glassware, and ensuring the floors are spotless are essential.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s only the inside that counts.**

While the interior is crucial, the external appearance of your venue also significantly impacts a guest’s first impression. Tasks like cleaning signage, sweeping entrance mats, and arranging outdoor furniture are vital.

## How do outdoor areas contribute to the guest’s first impression?

Outdoor areas are often the first point of contact a guest has with your venue. Ensuring these areas are clean and inviting directly influences a guest's initial perception and can determine whether they feel positive about their visit. Key tasks include ensuring signage is clean and visible, bins are not overflowing, ashtrays are empty, and outdoor furniture is tidy and in good condition.

**Common misunderstanding: Outdoor areas don’t need as much attention as indoors.**

Outdoor areas require just as much attention as indoor areas, if not more, because they are exposed to environmental elements. Neglecting these areas can lead to a negative first impression that is hard to reverse once the guest enters.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as it looks clean at a glance, it’s fine.**

A superficial clean might not address underlying issues like odours or hidden dirt, which can be noticed by guests as they spend more time in the area. A thorough cleaning is necessary to ensure all aspects are guest-ready.

## Why is the host stand and entrance area critical to service standards?

The host stand and entrance area set the tone for the guest's experience. They are the first interior areas a guest interacts with, so it's crucial they are clean, well-organised, and functional. This includes having a tidy host stand, clean floors, well-arranged furniture, and all necessary materials like menus and reservation systems ready and accessible.

**Common misunderstanding: The host area just needs to be tidy.**

More than just tidiness, the host area needs to be fully functional and efficient. This means ensuring all systems are operational, materials are at hand, and the space is optimised for quick guest processing.

**Common misunderstanding: Once set in the morning, the host stand doesn’t need attention until closing.**

The host area should be monitored and maintained throughout the day to manage any issues that arise from continuous use, such as clutter, spills, or disorganisation.
