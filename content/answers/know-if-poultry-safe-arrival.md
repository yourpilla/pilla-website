# How do I know if poultry is fresh when it arrives from a supplier?

When checking poultry deliveries, look for these key characteristics:

-   The skin should have a creamy colour without any blemishes or bruising
-   The meat should be moist but not slimy or dry
-   The flesh should feel firm when touched
-   There shouldn't be any strong odours
-   If it's a whole bird, it must be free of innards and internal organs

**Common misunderstanding: Fresh poultry should always be bright white in colour.**

The freshness of poultry is not determined by a bright white colour. Fresh chicken typically has a creamy color. A bright white appearance may indicate the use of additives or that the poultry has been treated in some way, which can affect quality. Always check for natural creaminess and avoid bright artificial appearances.

**Common misunderstanding: Poultry that feels slightly sticky is still fresh.**

Sticky poultry is a sign of spoilage. Fresh poultry should feel moist but not sticky or slimy. The presence of a sticky texture often indicates bacterial growth, which compromises freshness and safety.

## What if I'm not sure about the quality of the poultry I've received?

If you're unsure about the quality or have concerns, you should reject the delivery. It's better to be cautious than risk food safety. Make sure to clearly label any rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them separately while arranging return to the supplier.

**Common misunderstanding: If poultry has a slight odour, it can be masked by cooking and is safe to use.**

A slight odour in raw poultry can indicate bacterial contamination and should not be ignored. Cooking may kill bacteria, but it does not eliminate toxins that may have formed. Always reject poultry that has any off-putting odour to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to accept poultry deliveries if only a small part of the batch is questionable.**

Accepting any questionable poultry poses a risk to food safety. Even if only a part of the delivery shows signs of spoilage, it is safer to reject the entire batch, as contamination can spread. Always prioritise caution and food safety protocols.

## Should I check the temperature of poultry deliveries?

Yes, temperature checking is crucial for poultry. Use a clean, sanitised probe between packs (don't pierce the packaging). The ideal temperature should be below 5°C but not below 1°C. You can accept deliveries up to a maximum of 8°C, but anything above this must be rejected. Remember to record all temperature checks using your delivery task system.

**Common misunderstanding: If the delivery truck is refrigerated, there's no need to check the poultry temperature.**

Even if the delivery truck is refrigerated, it is essential to check the temperature upon arrival. Temperature fluctuations can occur during transit, and a refrigerated truck does not guarantee that the poultry has been kept at the correct temperature throughout the journey.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the poultry feels cold, it is safe to accept.**

Feeling cold is not a reliable indicator of safe temperature. Poultry must be checked with a calibrated thermometer to ensure it is within the correct range (below 5°C but not below 1°C). Relying on touch alone can lead to accepting unsafe products.
