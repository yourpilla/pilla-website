You must always take temperatures between packs of food using a clean and sanitised probe. Never pierce the packaging to take a temperature as this can compromise food safety and product integrity.

For chilled foods, you're looking for temperatures below 5°C (but not below 1°C). You can accept deliveries up to 8°C maximum. For frozen foods, aim for -18°C or slightly colder, with a maximum acceptable temperature of -15°C.

**Common misunderstanding: Piercing the packaging to check temperatures provides more accurate readings.**

Piercing packaging is not necessary for accurate temperature readings and can compromise food safety by introducing contaminants. Instead, use a properly calibrated probe thermometer to measure the temperature between packages, which ensures both accuracy and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Room temperature delivery trucks don't affect packaged food temperatures.**

Even if food is packaged, exposure to ambient temperatures in delivery trucks can lead to unsafe temperature levels. It's essential to verify that chilled foods are kept below 5°C and frozen foods are at or below -18°C to prevent bacterial growth and ensure food safety during transit.

## What happens if I find temperatures above these limits?

If you find chilled goods above 8°C or frozen goods above -15°C, you must reject the delivery immediately. Contact your supplier right away to arrange a replacement delivery. Make sure to document this rejection in your delivery records.

**Common misunderstanding: It's acceptable to accept a delivery with a slightly elevated temperature if it's a short-term issue.**

Accepting deliveries that exceed the recommended temperature thresholds, even slightly, increases the risk of food borne illnesses. Bacterial growth can rapidly occur at higher temperatures, making it crucial to adhere strictly to the specified limits and reject deliveries if they exceed these thresholds.

**Common misunderstanding: Documenting temperature deviations is unnecessary if the supplier replaces the product.**

Documenting temperature deviations is vital regardless of product replacement. It provides a record for compliance, helps identify recurring issues with suppliers, and ensures accountability in maintaining food safety standards.

## How long do I have to check temperatures once the delivery arrives?

You should aim to transfer food from the delivery point to storage areas within 15 minutes, including all temperature checks and unboxing. In exceptional circumstances, you have a maximum of 30 minutes, but remember that chilled foods must be prioritised first, followed by frozen goods, and then ambient/dry goods.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the total time from delivery to storage is under 30 minutes, the sequence of checks doesn't matter.**

The sequence in which foods are checked and stored is critical. Chilled foods should be prioritised to minimize time in the danger zone, followed by frozen goods. This sequence helps prevent temperature abuse and ensures food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a thermometer to check temperatures is unnecessary if the delivery is completed quickly.**

Regardless of speed, using a thermometer is essential for confirming that the food's temperature is within safe limits. Visual checks alone cannot determine if food has been kept at a safe temperature during transit.
