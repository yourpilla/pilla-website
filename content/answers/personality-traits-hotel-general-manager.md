# What personality traits should I look for when writing a Hotel General Manager job description?

When writing a job description for a Hotel General Manager, focus on personality traits that match the demands of the role and the hotel's environment. Traits like adaptability, leadership, and customer focus are often key. For instance, if your hotel thrives on high-energy and quick decision-making, look for someone who is resilient, decisive, and can handle stress well.

**Common misunderstanding: Personality traits are less important than skills and experience.**

While skills and experience are crucial, the right personality traits ensure a manager can effectively lead and fit into the hotel's culture, enhancing team performance and guest satisfaction.

**Common misunderstanding: All hotels should look for the same traits in a General Manager.**

Different types of hotels have different operational needs and cultures. A bustling city hotel might need a GM who thrives under pressure, whereas a relaxed resort might benefit from a GM who excels in creating a calm, welcoming atmosphere.

## How can I align a candidate’s personality with the hotel’s team culture?

To align a candidate's personality with your hotel's team culture, first clearly understand and define what your team values and the atmosphere of your workplace. For example, if your team values innovation and collaboration, you should look for candidates who are open-minded and excel in cooperative environments. Reflect on successful leaders within your hotel and identify the traits that contribute to their success.

**Common misunderstanding: A good General Manager can work well in any environment.**

Not all managers can adapt to any environment. It's important to find someone whose personality complements the specific culture and pace of your hotel to ensure long-term success.

**Common misunderstanding: You can fully gauge a candidate's fit during the interview.**

While interviews are important, consider using personality assessments and multiple interviews with various team members to better understand how well a candidate might mesh with your team and adapt to your hotel's culture.

## Why is it important to avoid clichés in defining the desired personality for a Hotel General Manager?

Avoiding clichés like "dynamic" or "motivated" and instead using specific, descriptive traits helps attract the right candidates. This clarity ensures that applicants have a realistic understanding of what is expected and can self-assess their fit for the role more accurately. It also helps the hiring team evaluate candidates against clear and relevant criteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Using general terms like 'hard-working' covers all bases.**

General terms can be interpreted in many ways and do not communicate the specific needs of your hotel. Detailed descriptions help in attracting candidates who are truly suited for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed personality descriptions limit the number of applicants.**

While a detailed description might reduce the quantity of applicants, it increases the quality of those who apply, ensuring they are more likely to be a good fit and to succeed in the role.
