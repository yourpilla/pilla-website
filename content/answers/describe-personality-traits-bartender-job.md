---
When writing a job description for a bartender, it's important to clearly describe the personality traits that will fit well with your team and venue. Start by thinking about the traits that make your best team members successful and the overall atmosphere of your bar. Use specific adjectives and examples to paint a clear picture of the type of person you're looking for.

**Common misunderstanding: Using vague terms like "hard-working" or "friendly" is enough.**

These terms are too broad and don't give potential candidates a real sense of what's expected. Instead, describe what these traits look like in action at your bar. For example, "hard-working" could be detailed as "someone who willingly takes on extra shifts during busy periods without being asked."

**Common misunderstanding: Personality traits aren't as important as skills.**

While skills are crucial, the right personality can significantly enhance how those skills are utilised and improve team dynamics and customer service. Traits like adaptability, teamwork, and customer engagement are just as important as technical skills.

## Which personal qualities are most valued in bartenders?

The most valued qualities in bartenders often include resilience, friendliness, and a strong work ethic. These traits help bartenders manage the fast-paced environment of a bar, interact positively with customers, and contribute to a team's success. Specific qualities might vary depending on the bar's atmosphere; for example, a high-energy sports bar might particularly value resilience and energy.

**Common misunderstanding: All bars value the same qualities in bartenders.**

Different types of bars might require different qualities. A cocktail lounge might value precision and a calm demeanor more highly than a bustling nightclub, which might prioritize speed and energy.

**Common misunderstanding: Technical skills outweigh personal qualities.**

While technical skills are essential, personal qualities often determine how well a bartender will fit into the existing team and handle the social aspects of the job. A bartender with excellent interpersonal skills can enhance customer experience significantly, leading to better tips and return customers.

## Why do traits like resilience and friendliness matter?

Resilience helps bartenders cope with the stress and high demands of busy shifts without compromising the quality of service. Friendliness is crucial as it influences customer experience; friendly bartenders can create a welcoming atmosphere that encourages customers to stay longer and return in the future.

**Common misunderstanding: Resilience is only about handling physical demands.**

While physical stamina is important, mental resilience is also crucial. It involves maintaining a positive attitude during long shifts and handling customer complaints gracefully.

**Common misunderstanding: Being friendly means only smiling and being polite.**

True friendliness in bartending also involves engaging with customers, remembering regulars' names and preferences, and being genuinely interested in providing an excellent service experience.
