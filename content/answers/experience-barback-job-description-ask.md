If your establishment features a complex cocktail menu and operates at a fast pace, consider candidates with more industry experience.

Consider the real needs of the role and focus on recruiting based on skills and attitude rather than just years of experience."

# How much experience should we ask for in a Barback job description?

When writing a Barback job description, it's important to match the experience level you ask for with the specific needs of your bar. For instance, if your bar has a complex cocktail menu and a fast-paced environment, you might need someone with more experience. However, if you're willing to provide training, you could consider hiring someone with less experience who is eager to learn.

**Common misunderstanding: Asking for more experience than necessary.**

It's a common mistake to ask for more experience than the job actually requires. This can discourage potentially great candidates who might lack years of experience but possess the right skills and attitude. Focus on what is truly necessary for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Equating experience with effectiveness.**

More years in the industry doesn't always mean a candidate is the best fit. Skills, personality, and the ability to mesh with your team are often just as important as the length of time someone has worked in a bar.

## How do we define the difference between entry-level and mid-level barbacks?

Defining the difference between entry-level and mid-level barbacks is crucial for setting clear expectations. Entry-level barbacks might not have any bar experience and are typically in a learning phase, requiring more guidance and training. Mid-level barbacks, however, should have some bar experience, understand basic operations, and be able to handle more responsibilities with less supervision.

**Common misunderstanding: Assuming all entry-level candidates lack skills.**

While entry-level barbacks may not have specific bar experience, they might bring other valuable skills from different jobs or industries, such as customer service or fast-paced work environments.

**Common misunderstanding: Overlooking the potential of promoting from within.**

Sometimes, the best mid-level candidates are your own entry-level barbacks who have grown and excelled in their roles. Consider internal training and promotion opportunities.

## Should we require time served or specific contextual experience?

It's more effective to require specific contextual experience rather than just time served. This means looking for experience that directly relates to the environment and pace of your bar. For example, a candidate with six months in a high-volume, fast-paced bar might be more suitable than someone with two years in a slow-paced, low-volume establishment.

**Common misunderstanding: Valuing quantity of time over quality of experience.**

Long tenure at a job doesn't necessarily translate to a good fit for your bar. Focus on the relevance of their experience to your specific needs.

**Common misunderstanding: Ignoring transferable skills.**

Candidates might have worked in different but related roles or industries with skills that are transferable to the barback position. Consider how these experiences might benefit your operations.
