Critical limits are specific thresholds that must be met to ensure food safety during production. These limits are set based on scientific research and are expressed as numerical values, such as temperatures or time limits. For example, cooking poultry to a minimum internal temperature is a critical limit that prevents harmful bacteria from surviving.

**Common misunderstanding: Critical limits are just guidelines and can be adjusted based on experience.**

Critical limits are not flexible guidelines; they are strict thresholds that must be adhered to. Adjusting these without proper scientific backing can lead to unsafe food that may harm consumers.

**Common misunderstanding: Critical limits are the same for all types of food businesses.**

Each food business may have different critical limits depending on the specific food items they handle. It’s important to develop limits that are tailored to the particular risks associated with your food products.

## Why must food businesses meet critical limits in HACCP?

Meeting critical limits in HACCP is essential to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure food safety. These limits are designed to control specific hazards that could lead to serious health risks if not properly managed. Failing to meet these limits can result in contaminated food, which can harm customers and damage a business’s reputation.

**Common misunderstanding: Meeting critical limits occasionally is sufficient to maintain food safety.**

Consistency in meeting critical limits is crucial. Occasional compliance is not enough as it leaves room for safety breaches that could lead to illness or even legal consequences.

**Common misunderstanding: Critical limits are only about temperature control.**

While temperature control is a significant aspect, critical limits also include other factors such as pH levels, salinity, and moisture content, depending on the food and process involved.

## What are examples of critical limits in hospitality settings?

In hospitality, critical limits can include cooking temperatures, such as ensuring poultry reaches at least 74°C, or cooling times, like cooling cooked food from 60°C to 20°C within two hours. Other examples might be the chlorine level in water used for washing vegetables or the time limits for holding food at safe temperatures.

**Common misunderstanding: All critical limits involve high temperatures.**

Some critical limits involve maintaining low temperatures, such as keeping cold foods at or below 8°C to inhibit bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: Critical limits are only for cooking and cooling.**

Critical limits also apply to other stages like storage, where specific humidity or light exposure levels must be controlled to ensure food safety.
