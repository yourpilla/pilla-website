# What is the safe reheating temperature for food?

To ensure food safety, reheated foods must reach a temperature that is high enough to kill harmful bacteria and reduce them to safe levels. The safe core temperature for reheated food is generally 75°C, but this can vary depending on local regulations.

**Common misunderstanding: Any warm temperature is safe for reheating food.**

Not all warm temperatures are safe. Foods need to reach at least 75°C to ensure bacteria are killed effectively. Lower temperatures may allow bacteria to survive and pose health risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheating food multiple times is safe as long as it reaches the safe temperature each time.**

Food should never be reheated more than once. Reheating multiple times can increase the risk of food poisoning, even if the food reaches the safe temperature each time.

## What is the minimum reheating temperature in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland?

In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the minimum safe temperature for reheating food is 75°C. This temperature must be reached at the core of the food to ensure it is safe for consumption.

**Common misunderstanding: The surface temperature of the food is enough to determine if it's safely reheated.**

The core temperature, not just the surface, needs to reach 75°C. Always use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the food.

**Common misunderstanding: Once food reaches 75°C, it can be left out before serving.**

Reheated food should be served immediately or kept in pre-heated hot holding equipment to maintain safety and quality.

## What is the minimum reheating temperature in Scotland?

In Scotland, the minimum safe temperature for reheating food is slightly higher, at 82°C. This requirement is specific to Scottish food hygiene laws and must be achieved at the core of the food.

**Common misunderstanding: The reheating temperature requirements are the same across the UK.**

Scotland has a distinct requirement of 82°C, compared to 75°C in other parts of the UK. Always check local guidelines.

**Common misunderstanding: Using any kitchen equipment to reheat food is acceptable as long as the temperature is reached.**

Only use equipment that is specifically designed for reheating to ensure rapid and even heating. Avoid using hot holding equipment for reheating.
