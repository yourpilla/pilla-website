  Closing checks in a kitchen help prevent several risks including food
  spoilage, pest infestations, and fire hazards.
---
Closing checks in a kitchen are designed to prevent several risks that can compromise food safety, attract pests, or cause equipment damage. These checks ensure that everything is clean, stored properly, and turned off. This helps avoid problems like food spoilage, pest infestations, and fire hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: Closing checks are just about cleaning.**

While cleaning is a big part of closing checks, they cover more than just hygiene. They ensure that the kitchen is safe and ready for the next day, which includes turning off equipment to prevent fire risks and securing food to prevent contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: If nothing went wrong during the day, closing checks aren’t necessary.**

Even if the day went smoothly, closing checks are still crucial. They are your last line of defence against potential overnight issues like pests or equipment left running, which could lead to bigger problems by morning.

## Why should you check that all bins are emptied and cleaned at night?

Emptying and cleaning bins at night is crucial to prevent pests like rodents and insects from being attracted to food scraps and waste. Clean bins also help maintain hygiene standards in the kitchen, reducing the risk of cross-contamination from old waste to food surfaces.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to leave a little waste in bins overnight.**

Even small amounts of waste can attract pests and cause unpleasant smells. It’s important to completely empty and clean all bins to maintain a hygienic environment.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the lid is closed, it doesn’t matter if the bin is cleaned.**

Closing the lid doesn’t prevent bacteria and pests if residues are left. Cleaning is essential to remove any traces that might attract pests or lead to bacterial growth.

## What can go wrong if equipment is left on overnight?

Leaving kitchen equipment on overnight can lead to serious issues such as increased fire risk, equipment damage, and unnecessary energy consumption. It can also lead to food safety hazards if refrigeration units are accidentally turned off or if hot equipment leads to the growth of bacteria in nearby food.

**Common misunderstanding: Modern equipment is designed to be left on; it’s not a risk.**

Even modern equipment can malfunction or contribute to fire risks if left running unattended. Always turn off equipment to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Turning equipment off and on again uses more energy than leaving it running.**

While some equipment has a higher energy use at startup, the risk of fire and the cost of potential damage far outweigh any small savings on your energy bill. Safety first!
