# How long can I keep meat in the freezer?

When freezing fresh meat, it's best to use it within one month. The meat needs to be properly wrapped and date labeled before freezing. For best results, make sure the meat is properly chilled (below 5°C) before placing it in the freezer - this helps the freezing process happen faster and maintains better quality.

Keep in mind that freezing fresh meat isn't ideal as it can be vulnerable to freezer burn and ice crystal formation, which can affect quality once defrosted.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezing meat for long periods makes it unsafe to eat.**

Freezing meat does not inherently make it unsafe, even if stored for longer than recommended. However, prolonged storage can lead to a decline in quality, such as flavour and texture, due to freezer burn. Meat remains safe indefinitely at 0°F (-18°C) or lower, but it's best to consume it within the suggested time frame for optimal quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Meat can be frozen immediately after purchase without any preparation.**

While meat can be frozen directly after purchase, preparing it properly before freezing maximises quality and safety. Ensuring the meat is chilled to below 5°C before freezing and wrapping it in airtight packaging prevents freezer burn and maintains its texture and flavour.

## What's the best way to wrap meat for freezing?

The key is to wrap meat securely in air-tight packaging. This prevents freezer burn, which shows up as grayish-brown leathery spots on frozen food. While freezer burn doesn't make food unsafe, it can significantly impact quality. If you notice minor freezer burn, you can cut away those areas before or after cooking, but heavily freezer-burned food should be thrown away.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to freeze meat in its original grocery store packaging.**

While it's safe to freeze meat in its original packaging, these materials are often permeable to air and can lead to freezer burn over time. For long-term storage, overwrap the original packaging with airtight materials such as heavy-duty aluminium foil or freezer wrap to protect the meat from air exposure and maintain quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Double wrapping meat is unnecessary and doesn’t improve preservation.**

Double wrapping is a recommended practice for long-term freezing as it provides an additional barrier against air and moisture, reducing the risk of freezer burn. It helps in maintaining the meat's quality by preventing air pockets and ensuring a tighter seal.

## What happens if my freezer breaks down while storing meat?

If your freezer fails, check if the meat is still frozen solid. If it's still hard and covered in ice, quickly move it to another freezer. If it's starting to defrost, move it to a fridge and use it within 48 hours. Never refreeze meat that has fully defrosted. If you're unsure about the meat's condition or suspect any cross-contamination, it's safer to discard it.

**Common misunderstanding: If the freezer breaks down, meat is always safe as long as it stays cold.**

While cold temperatures slow bacterial growth, the key factor is whether the meat remains frozen solid. If meat begins to thaw, its safety depends on how long it stays at a temperature conducive to bacterial growth. Use a thermometer to ensure the internal temperature of the meat remains safe (below 5°C) until it can be refrozen or cooked.

**Common misunderstanding: You can refreeze meat safely if it has thawed but still feels cold.**

Refreezing meat that has partially thawed can compromise its quality and safety. Once thawed, meat can develop bacterial growth if not kept cold enough. To ensure safety, only refreeze meat if it still contains ice crystals or has remained at a safe temperature (below 5°C) throughout the thawing process.
