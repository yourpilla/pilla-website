# Why is cooking food to the correct temperature important?

Cooking food to the correct temperature is important because it ensures that harmful bacteria are reduced to a safe level, making the food safe to eat. This process eliminates bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, which can cause food poisoning and other serious health issues.

**Common misunderstanding: If food looks cooked, it is safe to eat.**

Appearance can be deceiving. Even if food looks cooked, it might not have reached a temperature high enough to kill all harmful bacteria. Always use a food thermometer to check.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking at a higher temperature for a shorter time makes food safe.**

Each type of food requires a specific combination of temperature and time to ensure safety. Cooking at a higher temperature than recommended can compromise food quality without necessarily making it safe.

## What happens if food is not cooked to a safe temperature?

If food is not cooked to the recommended safe temperature, bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses may survive. This can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and in severe cases, more serious health issues such as kidney failure or even death.

**Common misunderstanding: A little undercooking doesn’t affect safety if the food is served hot.**

Serving food hot does not eliminate bacteria if the food has not reached its safe cooking temperature. The heat must be sufficient to kill bacteria throughout the food, not just on the surface.

**Common misunderstanding: All foods have the same safe temperature.**

Different foods require different cooking temperatures to be safe. For example, poultry needs to reach a higher internal temperature compared to some cuts of beef or pork.

## What are the recommended time and temperature combinations for safe cooking?

The scientifically proven time and temperature combinations to reduce bacteria to safe levels are as follows:

-   80°C for 6 seconds
-   75°C for 30 seconds
-   70°C for 2 minutes

**Common misunderstanding: You can estimate the temperature without a thermometer.**

Estimating temperature by touch or appearance is unreliable. Always use a food thermometer to ensure food reaches the safe temperatures listed above.
