# How do I know if meat is fresh when it arrives from a supplier?

When checking meat deliveries, there are several key signs of freshness to look for:

-   The meat should have an even red/brown color across all surfaces
-   It should feel moist but not slimy
-   There shouldn't be any strong odors
-   The fat should be creamy white (not yellow) and have clear marbling
-   The meat shouldn't feel dry to touch

Remember to check the temperature too - it should be below 5°C (and never above 8°C) when it arrives.

**Common misunderstanding: If meat is vacuum-sealed, it does not matter if it has a slight odour when you open it.**

While vacuum-sealing can help preserve meat, it should not have a strong or unpleasant odour when the package is opened. Such smells can indicate spoilage due to anaerobic bacteria growth. Always ensure the odour is mild and typical of fresh meat.

**Common misunderstanding: Meat that appears brown has gone bad.**

Brown coloration in meat does not automatically indicate spoilage. It can result from oxidation, a natural reaction when myoglobin in the meat is exposed to oxygen. However, it's important to assess other freshness indicators such as smell, texture, and temperature to determine quality.

## What should I do if I notice any issues with meat deliveries?

If you spot any problems with meat deliveries, you should:

-   Reject the delivery immediately
-   Contact the supplier right away
-   If you've already accepted the delivery but then notice issues, label it clearly as "not for consumption"
-   Store rejected items separately so they don't risk contaminating other products
-   Keep all documentation of the rejection for your records in the Pilla Task

**Common misunderstanding: You should always accept a delivery and sort out issues with the supplier later.**

Accepting a delivery with noticeable issues can complicate the process of addressing any complaints with the supplier. It's crucial to reject any suspicious deliveries immediately to avoid health risks and financial loss. Documenting the issues and contacting the supplier promptly is essential for resolution.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a meat delivery is rejected, it cannot affect your other products.**

Even rejected meat can pose a contamination risk if not handled properly. It is vital to store rejected items separately to prevent cross-contamination with other products. Ensuring a safe storage protocol is critical in maintaining overall product safety.
