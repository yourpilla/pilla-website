  If you don't have access to an alternative refrigeration unit during a
  breakdown, you must use the affected food within 4 hours if the temperature
  rises above 8°C.
---
If you don't have access to another refrigeration unit, you'll need to use the affected food within 4 hours of it being exposed to temperatures above 8°C. If you can't use it within this 4-hour window, you must discard it.

**Common misunderstanding: Food can be safely consumed after 4 hours at room temperature if it looks and smells fine.**

Appearance and smell are not reliable indicators of food safety. Harmful bacteria can multiply to dangerous levels without changing the food's appearance or odour. So it is essential to strictly follow the 4-hour rule to prevent food-borne illness.

## Does this 4-hour rule apply to all types of food?

There are special considerations for certain foods. Fresh fish, for example, must always be stored below 3°C - if it goes above this temperature, it needs to be discarded. Also, if you're unsure how long the food has been at an unsafe temperature (like during an overnight breakdown), you should discard it immediately rather than applying the 4-hour rule.

**Common misunderstanding: The 4-hour rule is always applicable, regardless of the food type or storage conditions.**

The 4-hour rule does not apply universally. Foods such as fresh fish and dairy products are more perishable and have stricter temperature thresholds. Fresh fish, for example, must be kept below 3°C. If these foods are exposed to higher temperatures, they must be discarded immediately.

**Common misunderstanding: If unsure about the duration of temperature exposure, you can still assess the food based on its texture.**

In situations where the duration of exposure to unsafe temperatures is uncertain, the safest course of action is to discard the food. Texture is not a reliable indicator of bacterial growth, which can occur without visible or tactile changes.

## What should we record in Pilla during this situation?

You need to document everything thoroughly in Pilla. This includes marking the fridge as an issue, recording all food temperatures, noting what food was used within the 4-hour window, and logging any food that had to be discarded. This documentation is important for future health inspections and demonstrates that you followed proper food safety protocols during the breakdown.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the fridge is fixed, there's no need to document past issues related to food storage.**

Thorough documentation in Pilla is important, even after the issue is resolved. Recording all details about the breakdown and how food was managed ensures compliance with food safety regulations and can be vital during health inspections.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the final outcomes like discarded food need to be recorded, not the process of monitoring temperatures.**

Recording the whole process, including monitoring temperatures, is essential. It provides a comprehensive account of how the situation was handled, which is critical for demonstrating adherence to safety protocols and can protect against liability in the event of a food safety incident.
