When you're hiring a barista, it's important they come with certain skills to ensure they can start effectively from day one. Essential skills include basic espresso making, milk steaming, and maintaining a clean and organised workspace. These skills are crucial for any barista to perform daily tasks efficiently and maintain the quality of service expected in a busy café environment.

Common misunderstanding: All barista skills can be trained on the job, so initial skills aren't important.

While many skills can be developed while working, having a foundation in espresso preparation and milk texturing is essential. This ensures the barista can handle basic coffee orders from the start, which is crucial during busy periods.

Common misunderstanding: Advanced coffee knowledge is a must for all baristas.

While a deep understanding of coffee can be beneficial, the essential skills required are more practical and focused on drink preparation and customer service. Advanced knowledge like bean origins or processing methods is usually not necessary for day-to-day operations unless specified by the café's niche.

## How do I identify which barista skills are nice-to-have versus required?

To distinguish between essential and nice-to-have skills, consider your café's specific needs and customer expectations. Essential skills are those necessary for daily operations, such as making espresso and using the POS system. Nice-to-have skills might include latte art or knowledge of specialty coffees, which can enhance customer experience but aren't critical for basic service delivery.

Common misunderstanding: All listed skills in a job description are critical.

Not all skills listed are mandatory; some are just preferred. It's important to clearly differentiate in your job postings which skills are required to perform the job effectively and which would be beneficial but not necessary.

Common misunderstanding: More skills listed means a better candidate.

While a wide range of skills can be appealing, focus on the core skills that directly impact your café's operation. Overemphasizing less relevant skills can lead to overlooking candidates who are strong in essential areas but may lack in less critical skills.

## What bar-specific tasks help me figure out the right skill requirements?

Consider the specific tasks that need to be performed at your bar. For instance, if your barista needs to operate a manual espresso machine, then skills in dialling in a grinder and espresso calibration are necessary. If the role involves customer interaction, strong communication skills are essential. Analyze the daily responsibilities and base your skill requirements on these practical needs.

Common misunderstanding: All baristas perform the same tasks, so skills are interchangeable.

Tasks can vary significantly between different types of coffee shops, such as high-volume takeaway spots versus sit-down cafés. It's important to tailor the skill requirements based on the specific tasks and service style of your venue.

Common misunderstanding: Generic skills cover all necessary tasks.

Generic skills might not adequately cover specific tasks critical to your operation. For example, a barista in a specialty coffee shop might need precise skills in brewing methods that wouldn't be necessary in a more standard café setting.
