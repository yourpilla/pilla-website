If you find that your reheating equipment is not working properly, it's important to take immediate action to ensure food safety. First, stop using the faulty equipment. Then, follow these steps: repair or replace the equipment, use alternative equipment, and increase supervision and retraining of staff if necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: Faulty equipment can still be used if it seems to be working 'good enough'.**

Using equipment that is not functioning properly can lead to underheating food, which may not kill harmful bacteria and can increase the risk of foodborne illness. Always ensure equipment is fully operational.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the temperature setting matters when checking if equipment is faulty.**

While correct temperature settings are crucial, other factors such as heating speed and even heat distribution are also important to ensure food is safely reheated.

## When should an engineer be called for faulty equipment?

An engineer should be called immediately if the equipment shows signs of malfunction that cannot be easily fixed by on-site staff or if it repeatedly fails to reach or maintain the required temperatures. This is crucial to prevent any potential health risks associated with improperly reheated food.

**Common misunderstanding: An engineer should only be called when the equipment stops working completely.**

Waiting until equipment fails completely can lead to unsafe food handling practices. It's better to address issues as soon as they arise to maintain continuous safe operation.

**Common misunderstanding: Regular maintenance checks are unnecessary if there are no immediate issues.**

Regular maintenance and checks can prevent sudden breakdowns and ensure that equipment consistently operates at peak efficiency, reducing the likelihood of needing urgent repairs.

## What temporary measures can be used if equipment breaks down?

If your primary reheating equipment breaks down, you can use alternative equipment that is adequate for reheating, such as ovens or microwaves, provided they can reach the required temperatures quickly. Additionally, you might consider dividing food into smaller portions to speed up the reheating process.

**Common misunderstanding: Any kitchen appliance can be used as a temporary solution for reheating.**

Not all kitchen appliances are suitable for reheating food safely. Only use appliances that can achieve and maintain the necessary temperatures quickly to avoid bacteria growth.

**Common misunderstanding: It's acceptable to delay reheating food until equipment is fixed.**

Delaying the reheating process can lead to food being kept in the danger zone (5-63Â°C) for too long, increasing the risk of bacterial growth. Always find an immediate solution.
