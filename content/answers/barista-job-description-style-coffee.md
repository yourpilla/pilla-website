# How do I ensure the Barista job description fits our style of coffee service?

Start by clearly defining your café's service style, pace, and values in the job description. This helps potential candidates understand what to expect and ensures they match your specific needs. Include details about the type of coffee service (e.g., fast-paced takeaway, sit-down café), the average number of coffees made per day, and any special practices like seasonal bean rotations or waste reduction efforts.

**Common misunderstanding: All barista job descriptions are similar, so a generic template will suffice.**

Each coffee service style has unique demands and expectations. A generic template might not capture the specific qualities and skills needed for your café's operation. Tailoring the job description to reflect your actual service style attracts candidates who are a better fit.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed descriptions scare away potential applicants.**

While too much detail can be overwhelming, the right amount ensures that applicants are well-informed about the role. This clarity can actually attract more qualified candidates who are confident in meeting your specific expectations.

## What changes if we run a specialty coffee bar versus a high-volume café?

If you run a specialty coffee bar, your job description should focus on skills like precision in coffee making, knowledge of various beans and brew methods, and a more personalised customer service approach. For a high-volume café, emphasize the ability to maintain quality and speed, manage a busy environment, and handle multiple orders efficiently.

**Common misunderstanding: The skills required for specialty and high-volume coffee bars are the same.**

While both types of coffee bars require foundational barista skills, a specialty coffee bar often demands a deeper understanding of coffee science and customer engagement, whereas a high-volume café prioritises speed and consistency under pressure.

**Common misunderstanding: A barista can easily switch between specialty and high-volume environments without additional training.**

Switching service styles can be challenging without proper training. Specialty coffee bars often require more detailed brewing techniques and customer interaction, which might not be as prioritised in high-volume settings.

## How specific should I be when describing equipment and prep duties?

Be as specific as possible about the equipment your baristas will use and their prep duties. This helps candidates assess if they have the relevant experience or interest in learning your systems. Mention the type of espresso machines, grinders, and any special brewing equipment. Also, detail the opening, service, and closing tasks they are expected to perform.

**Common misunderstanding: General descriptions of duties and equipment are adequate.**

Vague descriptions can lead to mismatches in employee expectations and actual job requirements. Specific details help in attracting candidates who are truly capable and enthusiastic about the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed equipment knowledge is not necessary for a barista.**

Understanding the specific equipment used in your café is crucial for maintaining the quality and consistency of the coffee served. Candidates familiar with your type of equipment are likely to perform better and adapt more quickly.
