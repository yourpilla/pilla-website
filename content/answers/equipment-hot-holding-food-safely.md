To keep food safe and at the right temperature, it's important to use equipment designed specifically for hot holding. This includes items like bain-maries, hot holding cabinets, and soup kettles. These are designed to maintain temperatures above 63°C, which is crucial to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Any heat source can be used for hot holding as long as the food stays warm.**

Not all heat sources are suitable for hot holding because they may not maintain a consistent and safe temperature. Proper hot holding equipment is designed to keep food at safe temperatures without cooking it further.

**Common misunderstanding: Hot holding equipment can also be used for cooking food.**

Hot holding equipment is meant to keep already cooked food at safe temperatures, not to cook food. Using it to cook food can lead to uneven heating and potential food safety risks.

## Why can't ovens or hobs be used for hot holding?

Ovens and hobs are primarily designed for cooking, not for holding food at a constant temperature. They can cause food to continue cooking, which might lead to drying out or burning. Additionally, they often do not have precise temperature controls to maintain the required temperature for safe hot holding.

**Common misunderstanding: Lowering the temperature on an oven can turn it into a hot holding device.**

Even at low settings, ovens are designed to cook and can fluctuate in temperature, which can be unsafe for hot holding. Consistent temperatures are key to safe hot holding.

**Common misunderstanding: Hobs can be set to a low heat for hot holding.**

Hobs are not suitable for hot holding because they provide direct heat which can lead to uneven temperature distribution, potentially allowing bacteria to grow on parts of the food that are not kept hot enough.

## What equipment is specifically designed for hot holding?

Equipment specifically designed for hot holding includes bain-maries, hot holding cabinets, and heated display cases. These devices are engineered to maintain a consistent temperature above 63°C, ensuring that food is kept out of the danger zone where bacteria can grow.

**Common misunderstanding: Any commercial warming equipment can be used for any type of food.**

Different types of hot holding equipment are suited for different types of food. For example, soup kettles are great for liquids, while heated display cases are better for solid foods like pastries or fried items.

**Common misunderstanding: Hot holding equipment doesn’t need regular checks once set up.**

Regular temperature checks are essential, even with specialized equipment, to ensure that it is functioning correctly and maintaining safe temperatures.
