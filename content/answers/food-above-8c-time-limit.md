# What's the maximum time food can be above 8°C before we have to throw it away?

Food that has been above 8°C must be thrown away after 4 hours. This is known as the 4-hour rule. It's important to note that this is only allowed once - you can't have multiple periods where food is above 8°C, even if each period is less than 4 hours.

**Common mistake: If food is only slightly above 8°C, it's safe to extend the 4-hour rule.**

This is incorrect. The 4-hour rule is based on the growth rate of bacteria at temperatures above 8°C. Even a slight increase can significantly enhance bacterial growth, making the food unsafe to consume after this period.

**Common mistake: You can reset the 4-hour rule by cooling the food back below 8°C and then reheating it.**

Once the food has been above 8°C for a total of 4 hours, it must be discarded. Cooling and reheating do not reset the clock, as bacteria may have already reached unsafe levels, posing a health risk.

## Does this apply to all types of food?

No, fresh fish has stricter requirements - it must be stored below 3°C at all times. If fresh fish goes above 3°C, it needs to be discarded immediately. For all other high-risk foods like cooked meats, dairy products, and prepared salads, the 4-hour rule applies.

**Common mistake: Fresh fish can be safely stored above 3°C.**

Fresh fish is highly perishable and must be stored below 3°C at all times to prevent rapid bacterial growth. Even short periods above this temperature can render fish unsafe, regardless of how quickly it is consumed.

## What should we do if we find food between 6-8°C?

If food temperature is between 6-8°C, you don't need to discard it immediately, but you should monitor it closely. Take the food temperature every hour to make sure it doesn't exceed 8°C. If the fridge is not working properly, try to transfer the food to another fridge that's maintaining the ideal temperature of below 5°C.
