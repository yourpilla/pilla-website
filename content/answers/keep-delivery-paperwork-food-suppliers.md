# Do I need to keep delivery paperwork from food suppliers?

Yes, it's essential to keep all delivery notes and invoices from your food suppliers. These documents need to be filed and stored securely as they serve multiple important purposes:

-   They help with tracking and maintaining good stock levels
-   They're crucial for product traceability if any issues arise
-   They provide proof of delivery temperatures and quality checks
-   They show any product substitutions that may affect allergen information

**Common misunderstanding: Delivery paperwork is only important for large-scale operations or chains.**

Delivery paperwork is equally important for small businesses. It ensures accountability, aids in inventory management, and provides vital information for resolving supplier disputes, regardless of the business size.

## How long should we keep these delivery documents for?

You should maintain a filing system for all delivery paperwork that allows you to trace products back to their source if needed. This is particularly important in cases of food-borne illness, allergic reactions, or contamination incidents where you need to notify and investigate suppliers.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a delivery is verified and accepted, the paperwork can be discarded.**

Discarding paperwork immediately can lead to significant issues if a product recall occurs or there is a need to trace a food safety issue back to its source. Retaining documents for at least one year, or as per local regulations, is essential for compliance and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital storage of delivery documents is risky and unreliable.**

Digital storage solutions offer secure and reliable options for document retention, often with robust backup and recovery features. They also provide easy access and organisation, making it simpler to manage and retrieve records when needed.

## What specific information should I check on delivery paperwork?

When checking delivery paperwork, ensure:

-   The delivery matches your original order
-   Any product substitutions are clearly documented (verbal notifications aren't acceptable)
-   The quantities delivered match what's on the paperwork
-   A responsible person has initialed the delivery note as correct and acceptable
-   Temperature records are included where relevant

**Common misunderstanding: Only discrepancies in quantity need to be reported on delivery paperwork.**

It's critical to report all discrepancies, including quality issues, incorrect items, or temperature deviations. These factors can affect product safety and quality, and addressing them in documentation helps maintain standards and supplier accountability.

**Common misunderstanding: Verbal agreements with suppliers are sufficient for any changes in the delivery.**

Relying solely on verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and lacks a formal record. Documenting all changes in delivery paperwork ensures clarity and provides a reliable reference for any disputes or audits.
