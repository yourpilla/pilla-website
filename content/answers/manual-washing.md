# How should I carry out manual dishwashing when the dishwasher is broken?

When your dishwasher is out of service, switch to manual dishwashing using a three-compartment sink. Start by washing dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water in the first compartment. Rinse them in clean water in the second compartment. Finally, sanitise them in the third compartment using an appropriate chemical sanitiser, like a chlorine solution or quaternary ammonium. Make sure all dishes and utensils air-dry fully on a clean, sanitised surface.

**Common misunderstanding: Manual dishwashing can be done in any sink if the dishwasher breaks down.**

Always use a designated three-compartment sink for manual dishwashing. This ensures that dishes are properly washed, rinsed, and sanitised, adhering to food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Any order of sinks can be used for washing, rinsing, and sanitising.**

The order is important: first wash, then rinse, and finally sanitise. This sequence prevents cross-contamination and ensures effective cleaning.

**Common misunderstanding: You can skip the sanitising step if the dishes look clean.**

Visual cleanliness isnâ€™t enough. Sanitising is essential to eliminate bacteria and ensure the dishes are safe for use.

## Why should dishes be air-dried instead of towel-dried?

Dishes should be air-dried to prevent the spread of bacteria and other contaminants that can occur with towel drying. Towels can harbour bacteria and reintroduce them to clean dishes, compromising their cleanliness.

**Common misunderstanding: Towel drying is just as effective as air drying.**

While towel drying might seem quicker, it risks contaminating dishes with bacteria from the towel. Air drying is a safer method.

**Common misunderstanding: Any clean towel is safe for drying dishes.**

Even clean towels can contain residual bacteria. Air drying is the recommended method to ensure dishes remain sanitary after washing.
