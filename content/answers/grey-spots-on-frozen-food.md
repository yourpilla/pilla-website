  Grey spots on frozen food, known as freezer burn, occur when air reaches the
  food's surface, causing dehydration and oxidation.
---
Those grey-brown leathery spots you're seeing are called freezer burn. This happens when air reaches the food's surface and causes dehydration and oxidation. While freezer burn doesn't make the food unsafe to eat, it can affect the quality and taste.

If the freezer burn is minor, you can cut away the affected areas before or after cooking. However, if the food is heavily affected by freezer burn, it's best to discard it for quality reasons.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burn means the food is spoiled and unsafe to eat.**

Freezer burn does not indicate spoilage or food safety issues. It is a result of moisture loss and oxidation when air reaches the food's surface. While it affects the texture and taste, it does not make the food unsafe to eat. You can cut away the affected areas and consume the rest safely, provided the food was stored properly before freezing.

## How can I prevent these grey spots from appearing on my frozen food?

The key to preventing freezer burn is proper wrapping and storage. Make sure your food is securely wrapped in air-tight packaging before freezing. When storing batch-cooked foods, portion them out and wrap them thoroughly. This helps them freeze faster and prevents air from reaching the food.If I find freezer burn on meat, should I throw it away immediately?

Not necessarily. If you find small areas of freezer burn on meat, you can simply cut away those affected parts either before or after cooking. However, if the meat has extensive freezer burn covering large areas, it's better to discard it. While it won't make you sick, heavily freezer-burned meat will have notably reduced quality in terms of texture and taste.
