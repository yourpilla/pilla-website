# What interview structure should I use for hiring a Barista?

Choosing the right interview structure for hiring a Barista depends on your café's service style, the role's seniority, and your specific needs. Common structures include a simple structure for quick hires, a full interview structure for most hires, and an extended structure for senior or lead Baristas.

**Common misunderstanding: A one-size-fits-all interview process is sufficient for all types of Barista roles.**

Each Barista role may require different skills and qualities. Tailoring the interview process to match the specific demands of the position ensures you assess the right attributes and fit for your café.

**Common misunderstanding: Longer interviews are always better.**

While thoroughness is important, the length and depth of an interview should align with the role's requirements. Overly long interviews can be unnecessary for junior or less critical roles and may waste resources.

## How do I decide between a short or extended interview?

Decide between a short or extended interview based on the role's complexity and responsibility level. Short interviews are typically sufficient for junior positions or when you're hiring for roles with straightforward tasks. Extended interviews are better for senior positions or roles requiring a deep understanding of coffee and customer service.

**Common misunderstanding: Short interviews can't provide enough insight into a candidate's capabilities.**

Even short interviews can be highly effective if well-structured with targeted questions and practical trials. They can efficiently reveal a candidate's basic skills and suitability for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Extended interviews are too demanding for candidates.**

Extended interviews are justified when the role demands a high level of skill and responsibility. They provide a comprehensive assessment of a candidate's abilities and fit within the team and culture.

## What factors should influence my Barista interview format?

Your Barista interview format should be influenced by factors such as the pace of your venue, the importance of teamwork versus technical skills, immediate versus long-term staffing needs, and the availability of training. These factors help determine the depth and focus of your interview process.

**Common misunderstanding: All cafés should use the same interview format.**

Different cafés have unique cultures, customer bases, and service styles. Customizing your interview format to reflect these elements ensures you find candidates who are not only skilled but also a good cultural fit.

**Common misunderstanding: Technical skills should always be the priority in interviews.**

While technical skills are important, the balance between skills and personality traits like teamwork and customer service should align with your café's operational needs and values. Sometimes, a great team player with basic skills is more valuable than a technically skilled individual who can't work well with others.
