Additionally, fish can be considered fresh if it is flash-frozen immediately after catch and properly thawed, as quick freezing preserves its quality."

When checking fish deliveries, there are several key indicators of freshness to look for:

-   The eyes should be bright and not sunken into the head
-   The flesh needs to be firm and have a fine layer of sea slime
-   Check that the gills are red in color
-   The scales should be difficult to remove and look fresh, not dry
-   There shouldn't be any strong fishy smell

**Common misunderstanding: If the fish is frozen at some point during transport, it can't be considered fresh.**

This is a misconception. Fish can be flash-frozen immediately after catch to preserve its freshness, a practice that locks in the quality at its peak. As long as the fish is properly thawed and handled, it can be just as fresh as never-frozen fish. The key is the quality and quickness of the freezing process.

**Common misunderstanding: Fresh fish should always smell like the sea.**

While a mild sea aroma can indicate freshness, the absence of a 'strong fishy smell' is a more reliable indicator. Fresh fish should have a neutral to slightly oceanic scent. A strong odour often means the fish is starting to spoil.

## What should I do if the fish delivery doesn't meet these standards?

If the fish doesn't meet any of these freshness standards, you should reject the delivery immediately. Make sure to clearly label any rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area for return to the supplier. Contact your supplier right away to arrange collection and replacement.

**Common misunderstanding: If you accept a delivery once, you have to accept it every time to maintain a good relationship with the supplier.**

This is not true. Consistent quality is a standard expectation in supplier relationships. Suppliers are generally receptive to feedback and rejection of substandard deliveries as it helps them maintain their own quality controls. Always prioritise food safety and quality over maintaining a potentially harmful status quo.

## How quickly do I need to get the fish into the fridge after delivery?

Fish, like all chilled goods, should ideally be transferred from the delivery point to appropriate storage within 15 minutes. In exceptional circumstances, you have a maximum of 30 minutes, but remember that maintaining the cold chain is critical. Fish should be your priority when putting away deliveries since it's particularly sensitive to temperature changes.

**Common misunderstanding: Fish doesn't need to be refrigerated immediately if it's packed with ice.**

While ice helps maintain a low temperature, it is not a substitute for refrigeration. Fish should be refrigerated as soon as possible to ensure a consistent cold chain and prevent bacterial growth. Ice can help during transport but is not a reliable long-term storage solution.
