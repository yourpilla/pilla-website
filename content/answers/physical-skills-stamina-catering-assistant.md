# What physical skills or stamina should I include in a Catering Assistant job description?

When writing a job description for a Catering Assistant, it's important to clearly outline the physical demands of the job. This might include tasks like standing for long periods, moving quickly during busy times, and lifting heavy items. Being upfront about these requirements helps potential candidates understand if they're a good fit for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Including detailed physical demands might discourage applicants.**

While it's true that detailing physical demands might narrow the pool of applicants, it ensures those who apply are better suited and prepared for the role. This clarity helps in selecting the right candidate who can perform the job effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: Any physical requirements are suitable as long as they are listed.**

It's crucial to only include physical demands that are genuinely necessary for the job. Overstating or including irrelevant physical requirements can lead to legal issues and limit your applicant pool unnecessarily.

## How can I phrase expectations for lifting, standing, or repetitive tasks?

Be specific and straightforward when phrasing physical expectations in your job description. For example, you might say, "Must be able to lift up to 20 kilograms" or "Comfortable standing for up to 8 hours during a shift." This specificity helps candidates gauge their ability to meet the physical demands of the job.

**Common misunderstanding: Vague descriptions like 'must handle physical tasks' are sufficient.**

Vague phrasing can lead to misunderstandings and unmet expectations. It's better to be explicit about what the job entails so candidates know exactly what will be expected of them.

**Common misunderstanding: Phrasing like 'must be strong' is appropriate for job descriptions.**

Instead of subjective terms like 'strong', use measurable criteria (e.g., 'able to lift 20 kilograms'). This makes your expectations clear and avoids any ambiguity.

## How do I balance realistic expectations with legal hiring practices?

Ensure that all physical requirements you list are essential for job performance and comply with employment laws. It's important to focus on the tasks the employee will need to perform and ensure these are directly related to the job's duties. Consult legal advice to make sure your job description does not discriminate against protected classes.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to include any physical demands if they occasionally occur.**

Only include physical demands that are a regular part of the job. Including tasks that are only occasionally required can be misleading and may open up potential legal challenges.

**Common misunderstanding: Using physical requirements to filter out less desirable candidates is acceptable.**

Physical requirements should only reflect the needs of the job, not serve as a filter for the candidate pool. Misusing these requirements can lead to discrimination claims and harm your company’s reputation.
