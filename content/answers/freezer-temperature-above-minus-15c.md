# What do I do if the freezer temperature goes above -15°C?

If your freezer temperature rises above -15°C, here's what you need to do:

1.  Wait one hour and check the temperature again
2.  If it's still above -15°C, you'll need to move all food to another freezer
3.  Check if foods are still completely hard - if they are, they can be safely relocated
4.  Any foods starting to defrost must go straight into a fridge and be used within 48 hoursItems like ice cream that must stay frozen should be used immediately or discarded

## What if I don't have another freezer to move the food to?

If you don't have access to another freezer, you'll need to follow these steps:

-   Move any food that's starting to defrost to a fridge immediately
-   Use these items within 48 hours
-   Never refreeze any food that has started to defrost
-   Discard items like ice cream that must remain frozen

**Common misunderstanding: Once food begins to defrost, it is safe to refreeze it if it still feels cold.**

Refreezing defrosted food can lead to significant quality degradation and increases the risk of bacterial growth. It is important to use defrosted food within 48 hours if kept in the fridge, and never refreeze it once it has begun to thaw.

## How can I prevent this from happening again

To prevent future temperature issues:

-   Check condenser vents and seals weekly for cleanliness and damage
-   Don't overload the freezer - ensure proper air circulation
-   Keep the freezer door closed as much as possible
-   Make sure the unit is regularly defrosted if it's not auto-defrost
-   Consider calling an engineer to check the unit if problems persist
