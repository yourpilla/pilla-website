# What's the proper way to clean a food probe thermometer?

To properly clean a food probe thermometer, you need to follow a two-step process:

1\. First, wash the probe with warm soapy water to remove any visible dirt or debris, then rinse it thoroughly with clean water to remove soap residue.

2\. Next, sanitise the probe using either alcohol swabs or a bleach solution to eliminate any remaining bacteria or allergens.

This dual cleaning and sanitising approach prevents cross-contamination between different foods when using the probe.

**Common misunderstanding: Sanitising a food probe thermometer with hot water is sufficient to eliminate bacteria.**

While hot water can help to remove some bacteria, it is not sufficient for complete sanitisation. To effectively eliminate bacteria, it's essential to use a sanitising agent such as alcohol swabs or a bleach solution after washing the probe with hot soapy water. This ensures that any remaining bacteria are thoroughly eradicated, preventing cross-contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: You only need to clean a food probe thermometer if it appears dirty.**

Even if a food probe thermometer looks clean, it can still harbor harmful bacteria that aren't visible to the naked eye. Regular cleaning and sanitisation after each use are critical to ensure that invisible pathogens do not transfer between food items, maintaining food safety standards.

## How often should I clean my probe thermometer?

You should clean and sanitise your probe thermometer before each use. This ensures accurate readings and prevents any cross-contamination between different food items. It's especially important when moving from testing raw foods to cooked foods.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning a probe thermometer once a day is enough, even if used multiple times.**

It's a misconception that cleaning a probe thermometer once a day is adequate. To ensure food safety and accurate readings, it is crucial to clean and sanitise the probe before each use, especially when switching between different food types or from raw to cooked foods. This practice prevents cross-contamination and maintains hygiene standards.

## What should I look for when cleaning my probe to make sure it's still working properly?

While cleaning, inspect the probe for any signs of damage or wear including:

-   Cracks or chips in the probe
-   Bent or misshapen probe tip
-   Foggy or leaking display
-   Any structural damage that could affect readings

If you notice any of these issues, the probe should be taken out of service and replaced to ensure accurate temperature readings.

**Common misunderstanding: If the thermometer is still displaying temperatures, it is functioning correctly.**

Just because a thermometer displays a temperature doesn't guarantee its accuracy or reliability. Regularly inspect for physical damage such as cracks, bends, or a foggy display, which can all affect the accuracy of the readings. If any damage is detected, replace the thermometer to ensure precise temperature measurement.
