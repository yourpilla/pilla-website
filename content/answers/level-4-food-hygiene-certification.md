---
Level 4 food hygiene certification is required for senior management positions, specifically executive head chefs and members of the HACCP team who are responsible for the overall food safety compliance of the business.

Unlike other food hygiene certificates, Level 4 doesn't require renewal, though continuing professional development is expected to stay current with industry standards.

It's important to note that this training must be completed in person rather than online due to the complexity of the content.

**Common misunderstanding: Level 4 food hygiene certification is only necessary if you're running a large kitchen operation.**

While larger operations certainly require Level 4 certification for senior roles, any establishment, regardless of size, that is committed to maintaining high food safety standards should ensure their senior management possess this level of knowledge. The complexity of food safety management systems demands comprehensive understanding, which is crucial in both large and small-scale operations to prevent foodborne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: Once you achieve a Level 4 food hygiene certification, you are covered for life without any further learning.**

Although Level 4 certification does not require renewal, ongoing professional development is crucial. Food safety standards and regulations evolve, and staying informed about the latest practices and legal requirements is essential to maintaining compliance and ensuring food safety excellence.

## What about my sous chefs, do they need Level 4 too?

No, sous chefs need Level 3 certification, not Level 4. Level 3 is appropriate for supervisory roles like sous chefs and bar managers who oversee food safety practices but aren't responsible for the overall food safety management system.

**Common misunderstanding: Level 3 certification is required for all kitchen staff handling food.**

Level 3 certification is designed for supervisory roles, such as sous chefs, who oversee food safety practices. However, kitchen staff directly involved in food preparation might only require Level 2 certification, which covers basic food hygiene principles. It's important to match the certification level with the specific responsibilities of the staff involved.

## Can I do Level 4 training online to save time?

No, Level 4 certification should be completed in person. This is because the advanced content requires detailed explanations and one-to-one interaction with tutors. The face-to-face learning environment allows for important discussions and questions about advanced food safety management principles that you'll need to implement in your business.
