# How should whole cuts of meat be cooked safely?

To cook whole cuts of meat safely, ensure that the outside is fully sealed by cooking at high temperatures. This process kills any bacteria present on the surface of the meat. It's also crucial to use a food thermometer to check that the meat has reached the appropriate internal temperature for safe consumption.

**Common misunderstanding: All parts of the meat need to be cooked to high temperatures.**

Only the outer surface of whole cuts, such as steaks or roasts, needs to be seared or cooked at high temperatures to kill surface bacteria. The interior can remain at lower temperatures, depending on the desired level of doneness.

**Common misunderstanding: Sealing meat involves cooking it through completely.**

Sealing meat refers to quickly cooking the external surfaces at high temperatures, not cooking it through. This method effectively kills surface bacteria while the interior can be cooked to a lesser degree, depending on preference.

## When is it safe to serve whole cuts rare?

Whole cuts of meat like beef or lamb can be served rare as long as the exterior has been properly sealed. This process involves cooking the surface at a high temperature to kill any bacteria. The interior of these meats is generally free from bacteria unless the meat has been punctured or injected.

**Common misunderstanding: Rare meat is unsafe because itâ€™s undercooked.**

Rare meat is safe to consume as long as the external surfaces have been properly sealed to eliminate bacteria. The internal parts of whole cuts are typically free from bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Any cut of meat can be served rare.**

Only whole cuts of meat can be safely served rare. Minced or rolled meats must be cooked thoroughly due to potential bacteria throughout the product.

## Why is it important to buy whole cuts from reputable suppliers?

Buying whole cuts of meat from reputable suppliers ensures that the meat has been handled and processed according to strict food safety standards, reducing the risk of contamination. Reputable suppliers are more likely to have consistent, high-quality safety practices in place.

**Common misunderstanding: All meat suppliers follow the same safety standards.**

Not all suppliers adhere to the same safety protocols. Reputable suppliers typically follow higher standards and are regularly inspected, ensuring safer products.

**Common misunderstanding: The cooking process eliminates all risks, regardless of the supplier.**

While cooking can reduce certain risks, starting with high-quality meat from a reputable supplier adds an extra layer of safety by minimising the chance of initial contamination.
