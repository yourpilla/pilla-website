Yes, you absolutely need to record all fridge temperatures, even when they're within the normal range. It's a legal requirement to monitor and record fridge temperatures. These records create an essential paper trail that proves you're maintaining proper food safety standards. Using the Pilla app to record temperatures will automatically log who checked it and when.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording fridge temperatures is only necessary during health inspections or when there are issues with the fridge.**

This is incorrect. Consistent recording of fridge temperatures is a continuous requirement, not just during health inspections or when problems arise. Regular documentation ensures compliance with food safety regulations and helps in early detection of potential issues, thus preventing food spoilage and ensuring customer safety.

## What happens if I miss recording a temperature check?

Missing temperature checks can be problematic because you won't have documentation to show health inspectors that your fridges were operating correctly during that time. Even if the temperatures were fine, without the records, you can't prove it. That's why it's crucial to maintain consistent twice-daily recordings. If you've forgotten to check a fridge, there's not much you can do afterwards about it. Consider updates you can make to you routine to make sure you don't forget again or consider extra training for staff.

**Common misunderstanding: If you miss a temperature check, you can simply estimate the temperatures and record them later.**

Estimating and recording temperatures after the fact is not acceptable and may be considered a violation of food safety protocols. Accurate, real-time data is essential for compliance and safety. It's important to implement reliable routines and automated reminders to ensure checks are conducted and recorded without fail.

## What exactly should I record when logging temperatures?

When recording temperatures in Pilla, you need to log the actual temperature reading from each fridge unit. The target temperature should be below 5°C, though the critical limit is 8°C. If you notice any issues and take corrective actions then record these in the comments section. Remember that these records are your proof of due diligence in maintaining food safety standards.
