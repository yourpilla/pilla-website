# How do I decide who might be harmed in a front of house risk assessment?

When conducting a front of house risk assessment, think about all the different groups of people who interact with the space. This includes staff, customers, and any other visitors. Consider how each group uses the space and what specific risks they might face. For example, staff might be at risk from carrying heavy trays, while customers could slip on a wet floor.

**Common misunderstanding: Only focus on staff risks, assuming customers are always safe.**

It's important to consider everyone who might be affected, not just the staff. Customers, delivery personnel, and even passersby can be at risk if not properly considered in the risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: Assuming that risks are the same at all times.**

Risks can vary significantly depending on the time of day or the specific event happening in the front of house. Always consider different scenarios like busy meal times or special events which might introduce unique risks.

## What types of staff are most at risk in front of house operations?

Typically, staff members who are directly engaged with the physical aspects of the front of house operations face more risks. This includes waiters, bartenders, hosts, and cleaners. They might encounter risks like slips, trips, manual handling injuries, and even burns or cuts from handling hot or sharp objects.

**Common misunderstanding: Managers and supervisors are at low risk.**

While they may not be directly involved in serving or cleaning, managers and supervisors can still face risks, especially during conflict resolution or when they need to step in to help with unexpected issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Part-time or temporary staff face fewer risks.**

Part-time or temporary staff are often less familiar with the workspace, which can actually put them at a higher risk of accidents due to unfamiliarity with the environment and procedures.

## How should customer safety be considered in front of house risk assessments?

Customer safety should be a priority in your risk assessment. Consider all the areas customers will access and think about potential risks such as slips, trips, and falls, especially in crowded or poorly lit areas. Also, consider the risk of food allergies and ensure that there's clear communication about ingredients.

**Common misunderstanding: Customers are responsible for their own safety.**

While customers should take care, it's the responsibility of the establishment to ensure the environment is as safe as possible. This includes clear signage for potential hazards and ensuring all walkways are free from obstacles.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the risk assessment is done, no further action is required for customer safety.**

Risks can change, and new risks can emerge. Regular reviews of the risk assessment are necessary to adapt to changes and ensure customer safety is always maintained.
