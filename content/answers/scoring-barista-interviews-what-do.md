After you've scored each Barista candidate, take some time to review the scores and notes. Discuss these with your team if possible. This helps ensure you choose a candidate who not only fits the technical requirements but will also blend well with your team's culture and work ethic.

**Common misunderstanding: The candidate with the highest score is always the best choice.**

While high scores are important, they aren't the only factor. Consider other elements like team dynamics and future potential. Sometimes a candidate with a slightly lower score might be a better fit for your team's specific needs.

**Common misunderstanding: Immediate decision-making post-interview is best to quickly fill the position.**

Rushing to make a hiring decision can lead to overlooking important factors. Take your time to reflect on all aspects of the candidate's performance and fit within your team.

## How do I reflect on a candidate’s overall fit?

Reflecting on a candidate's overall fit involves looking beyond their technical skills and considering their potential to thrive within your team's environment. Review their performance during the practical trials, their interaction with the team, and their responses during the interview to assess their adaptability, attitude, and alignment with your café's culture.

**Common misunderstanding: Fit is just about getting along with the team.**

While interpersonal chemistry is crucial, 'fit' also includes alignment with your café's values, work ethic, and long-term goals. A candidate who shares these broader aspects is likely to contribute positively in the long run.

**Common misunderstanding: A good fit will adapt automatically to any team situation.**

Adaptability is important, but it's also necessary to consider how well a candidate's core work style and values mesh with your existing team. Some aspects of 'fit' cannot be adjusted through training or adaptation.

## What questions help decide between two good Baristas?

When deciding between two strong candidates, consider asking reflective questions about each candidate's performance and potential impact. Questions like "Which candidate demonstrated a stronger understanding of our customer service values?" or "Who showed more initiative in learning and adapting during the trial?" can help differentiate between the two.

**Common misunderstanding: Both candidates are similar, so either choice is fine.**

Even if candidates appear similar, subtle differences in their service style, learning ability, and interaction with others can make a significant impact on their effectiveness in your café.

**Common misunderstanding: The decision should be based solely on the trial performance.**

While the trial is important, also consider how each candidate might grow with your business. Think about their potential for development and how they might handle future challenges.
