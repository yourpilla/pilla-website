Yes, having task lighting in your coffee machine area is crucial. Good lighting ensures that staff can see the machine's controls, identify hazards like steam or spills, and perform cleaning and maintenance safely. This reduces the risk of accidents such as burns or spills during busy shifts.

**Common misunderstanding: General room lighting is enough for safe operation.**

General overhead lighting may not be sufficient, especially if the coffee machine is positioned under cabinets or shelves that create shadows. Task lighting provides focused light directly over the machine, improving visibility and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Task lighting is only necessary for detailed mechanical work.**

While task lighting is essential for maintenance, it's also important during normal operation to help staff quickly and safely use the machine's features and notice any warning signs or spills.

## What signs or labels should be displayed on an espresso machine?

It's important to display clear and legible safety signage on and around your espresso machine. Signs should include warnings about hot surfaces, electrical hazards, and any specific operational instructions. Ensure signs like "Hot Surface", "Electrical Danger", and procedural reminders such as "Wear Gloves When Descaling" are visible.

**Common misunderstanding: Manufacturer's stickers on the machine are sufficient.**

While manufacturer's stickers provide basic safety information, you should supplement these with signs specific to your operational practices and any additional hazards identified in your risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: Once signs are up, no further action is needed.**

Safety signs can wear out or become obscured over time. Regular checks and updates are necessary to maintain visibility and relevance, especially in high-traffic areas where signs may get covered or damaged.

## How often should I check coffee machine safety signage?

Safety signage around your coffee machine should be checked at least monthly to ensure they are still clear, legible, and securely fastened. This helps in maintaining a safe working environment and ensures compliance with health and safety regulations.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking once a year during the annual review is enough.**

Due to the high usage and potential for wear and tear in a busy coffee service area, monthly checks are recommended to address any issues promptly.

**Common misunderstanding: If no one has reported a problem, the signs must be fine.**

Don't wait for issues to be reported. Proactive checks ensure that all safety measures are always in optimal condition, preventing potential oversight that could lead to accidents.
