# What format do EHOs follow when inspecting a business?

When an Environmental Health Officer (EHO) inspects your hospitality business, they follow a specific format outlined in the Food Law Code of Practice. This includes assessing your food safety and hygiene practices, the structure and cleanliness of your premises, and your management systems to ensure compliance with food safety laws.

**Common misunderstanding: EHO inspections are random and unstructured.**

Actually, EHO inspections are systematic and follow a well-defined process to ensure that all aspects of food safety are checked thoroughly.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs only check the kitchen area.**

EHOs inspect all areas related to food handling within your business, not just the kitchen. This includes storage areas, waste disposal areas, and even the condition of facilities like handwashing stations.

## What areas are assessed during an EHO inspection?

During an inspection, an EHO will assess three main areas: food safety and hygiene, structure and cleaning, and confidence in management. This includes how food is stored, handled, and prepared, the cleanliness and condition of the premises, and how well food safety management systems are implemented and records kept.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs only focus on the food itself.**

While food handling practices are crucial, EHOs also pay close attention to the environment in which the food is prepared and the management's ability to maintain food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: A clean front area guarantees a good inspection result.**

Cleanliness in customer-facing areas is important, but EHOs also scrutinise behind-the-scenes areas like storage and preparation rooms where customers don't usually see.

## How does an EHO determine a food hygiene rating?

An EHO determines a food hygiene rating by assessing the overall level of compliance with food safety laws observed during their inspection. They look at how well the business manages and records its food safety practices, the condition of the structure, and the management's ability to maintain these standards. Ratings range from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good).

**Common misunderstanding: The food hygiene rating is based solely on food quality.**

The rating reflects the safety and hygiene standards, not the quality or taste of the food served.

**Common misunderstanding: A low rating means the food is not safe to eat.**

A low rating indicates issues with how food safety is managed, which could potentially compromise food safety, but it does not automatically mean the food is unsafe.
