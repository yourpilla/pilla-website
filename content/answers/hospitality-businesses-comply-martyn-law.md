  Hospitality businesses that anticipate hosting 200 or more individuals,
  including staff and customers, simultaneously must comply with Martyn's Law.
---
Hospitality businesses that expect to host 200 or more people at the same time, including staff and customers, must comply with Martyn's Law. This includes a range of venues such as restaurants, pubs, bars, hotels, nightclubs, and entertainment venues. The law aims to ensure these places are prepared for potential terrorist attacks by implementing specific security measures.

**Common misunderstanding: Only venues in large cities need to comply with Martyn's Law.**

Regardless of location, any venue that meets the size threshold must comply. It's not just about being in a big city; it's about the capacity and the potential risk.

**Common misunderstanding: All hospitality venues, regardless of size, must comply with Martyn's Law.**

Actually, only venues that can host 200 or more people are legally required to comply. Smaller venues, while not legally obliged, are encouraged to adopt good security practices voluntarily.

## What types of venues are covered under the law?

Martyn's Law covers venues that are "wholly or mainly used" for hospitality and leisure activities. This includes restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, nightclubs, hotels, theatres, cinemas, concert halls, sports grounds, and other entertainment or visitor attractions. The law applies if these venues are open to the public or host public events.

**Common misunderstanding: Private clubs and invitation-only venues must comply with Martyn's Law.**

Private venues that do not allow public access, such as private members’ clubs or invitation-only event spaces, are not covered by Martyn's Law.

**Common misunderstanding: Retail shops are not affected by Martyn's Law.**

While the focus here is on hospitality, it's important to note that retail shops are also included under the law if they meet the size and public access criteria.

## How does the 200-person size threshold apply to hospitality venues?

The 200-person threshold includes everyone who might be in the venue at the same time—this means staff, customers, and guests. If it is reasonable to expect that your venue could host 200 or more people at once, even occasionally, then Martyn's Law applies to you. This threshold helps determine which venues need to implement the law's security measures.

**Common misunderstanding: The 200-person threshold only includes paying customers.**

The count includes all individuals present, not just paying customers. Staff and any other persons in the venue are also included in this total.

If your venue occasionally hosts events or gatherings that exceed 200 people, it falls under the scope of Martyn's Law for those events, even if regular operations do not typically reach this number.
