Identifying hazards in a kitchen is a crucial first step in creating a safe working environment. Start by walking through the kitchen during different times like prep, service, and clean-down to see what potential hazards arise. Observe the tasks being performed, check the condition of equipment, and discuss with the team about their experiences and near misses.

**Common misunderstanding: You can identify all hazards by just reviewing kitchen procedures from your office.**

Real-world observation is essential. You need to be in the kitchen, watching how the team works and interacts with the environment during actual operations to spot potential hazards effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: Once hazards are identified, no further input is needed from the team.**

Continuous feedback from the team is vital. They are the ones facing these hazards daily and might have valuable insights into what poses a real risk and how these risks could be mitigated.

## What are common hazards to include in a kitchen risk assessment?

Common hazards in a kitchen include slips, trips, and falls, especially near wet areas; burns from hot equipment like ovens and fryers; cuts from sharp knives and equipment; manual handling injuries from lifting heavy items; chemical burns from cleaning products; and allergies triggered by food handling. Ensure these are all considered in your risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: All hazards need to be included in the risk assessment.**

Only significant hazards need to be included. You can't list every single tiny hazard otherwise you would never be finished and it would put too much pressure on your business.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchens have the same hazards.**

While many hazards are common, each kitchen has unique elements based on its layout, equipment, and menu that might introduce specific risks. Tailor your assessment to reflect your specific kitchen environment.

## When is the best time to observe hazards in the kitchen?

The best times to observe hazards in the kitchen are during peak hours such as meal prep and service times when the kitchen is busiest and most staff are present. This allows you to see how staff interact under pressure and identify risks that might not be apparent during quieter times.

**Common misunderstanding: Observing once is enough to understand all hazards.**

Hazards can vary with different shifts. Multiple observations at different times and days can provide a more complete picture of the potential risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the kitchen manager needs to observe for hazards.**

While the kitchen manager plays a crucial role, involving other team members in the observation process can provide additional perspectives and lead to a more thorough identification of hazards.
