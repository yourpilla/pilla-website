# What does conducting a hazard analysis involve in HACCP?

Conducting a hazard analysis in HACCP means identifying potential food safety risks at each step of your food production and handling processes. This is the first and crucial step in creating a HACCP plan. It involves looking at each stage, from receiving ingredients to serving customers, and pinpointing where things might go wrong, like contamination or growth of bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Hazard analysis is only about spotting obvious risks.**

Hazard analysis goes beyond the obvious; it requires a detailed examination of each step in your process to identify not just visible risks but also those that are less apparent. This includes considering how ingredients are stored, how food is prepared, and even how it is served.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a hazard analysis is done, it doesnâ€™t need to be revisited.**

Hazard analysis is not a one-time task. It should be revisited and updated regularly to reflect changes in processes, ingredients, or regulations. Keeping your hazard analysis current ensures ongoing food safety.

## How do you evaluate food safety hazards effectively?

To effectively evaluate food safety hazards, you need to assess the severity and likelihood of each identified hazard causing harm. This involves understanding the potential impact of each hazard and the probability of its occurrence. Factors like temperature control, cross-contamination risks, and employee hygiene practices are all considered during this evaluation.

**Common misunderstanding: All hazards are equally dangerous.**

Not all hazards pose the same level of risk. Some might be critical and require immediate action, while others might be less severe. Prioritising hazards based on their risk helps in focusing resources on controlling the most significant threats first.

**Common misunderstanding: Evaluation is subjective and varies greatly between evaluators.**

While there's a subjective element, using established guidelines and criteria for evaluating hazards can standardise the process. Training and clear protocols help ensure that evaluations are consistent and based on sound judgment.

## What types of hazards should be identified in a HACCP plan?

In a HACCP plan, you should identify three main types of hazards: biological, chemical, and physical. Biological hazards include bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Chemical hazards could be pesticides, food additives, or toxins. Physical hazards are foreign objects like glass, metal fragments, or bone shards that might contaminate food.

**Common misunderstanding: Only raw ingredients pose hazards.**

Hazards can be introduced at any stage of the food production process, not just from raw ingredients. Contamination can also occur through improper handling, incorrect storage, or cross-contamination with other foods.

**Common misunderstanding: Larger pieces of physical contamination are the main concern.**

While larger objects are a concern, smaller and less detectable items like hair or small pieces of plastic are also significant hazards. These can often go unnoticed but pose a real risk to food safety.
