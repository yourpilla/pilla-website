There are several key signs to look out for that indicate your probe thermometer might be damaged:

-   Any bending or physical damage to the probe tip
-   Cracks in the display screen
-   Foggy or leaked interior
-   Inconsistent or unstable readings
-   Scale markings that are difficult to read

If you notice any of these issues, you should take the probe out of service immediately and arrange for a replacement, record everything as a comment on a task.

**Common misunderstanding: A food probe thermometer that displays the correct temperature once is guaranteed to be undamaged.**

A single accurate reading does not ensure the thermometer is undamaged. Damage may affect the consistency of readings or become apparent under specific conditions, such as extreme temperatures. Regular checks and maintenance are crucial to ensure reliability.

**Common misunderstanding: If the thermometer's display screen is cracked, it's still usable if the readings appear correct.**

A cracked display can lead to moisture ingress and further internal damage, potentially affecting accuracy over time. It's best to replace the thermometer to prevent reliability issues and ensure food safety.

## What should I do if I think my probe is giving incorrect readings?

If you suspect your probe isn't reading correctly, you should perform both a hot and cold test. For hot testing, use boiling water which should read 100°C (with 1 degree tolerance either way). For cold testing, use an ice bath which should read 0°C. If the readings fall outside these ranges, have your head chef verify the readings, record it in Pilla, and arrange for a replacement probe.

**Common misunderstanding: You only need to test the probe thermometer in one temperature range to ensure its accuracy.**

Testing across both hot and cold ranges is essential because different types of damage or calibration issues can affect the thermometer's performance at different temperatures. Ensuring accuracy across both ends of the spectrum confirms its overall reliability.

**Common misunderstanding: A slight deviation in temperature readings is acceptable and doesn’t require action.**

Even minor deviations can be significant in food safety, particularly in ensuring foods reach safe cooking temperatures. Regular calibration and immediate action on inconsistent readings are necessary to maintain high safety standards.

## How can I prevent my probe from getting damaged?

To maintain your probe's condition and accuracy:

-   Never leave it in extreme temperatures (like fridges or ovens)
-   Don't submerge it in liquids

-   Store it in its protective case when not in use
-   Replace batteries regularly
-   Keep it clean and sanitised between uses
-   Handle it carefully to avoid drops or impacts

**Common misunderstanding: Submerging the probe in water is an effective way to clean it thoroughly.**

Submerging the probe can damage its internal components. Instead, clean the probe by wiping it with a damp cloth and sanitising solution to maintain both hygiene and functionality.

**Common misunderstanding: The protective case is only necessary for storage during transportation.**

Using the protective case whenever the probe is not in use helps prevent accidental damage from impacts or environmental factors, extending the thermometer's lifespan and maintaining its accuracy.
