# How should front of house cleaning tasks be assigned to specific roles?

Assigning cleaning tasks to specific roles ensures that every task is completed consistently and efficiently. For example, you might assign entrance cleaning to the host and table cleaning to servers. This clear division of responsibilities helps prevent tasks from being overlooked during busy periods.

**Common misunderstanding: All staff can manage cleaning tasks spontaneously during their shifts.**

While flexibility is important, having specific roles assigned to cleaning tasks ensures nothing is missed and standards are maintained. It prevents the assumption that someone else will handle the task.

**Common misunderstanding: Assigning tasks to specific roles makes the cleaning process rigid.**

On the contrary, it creates a structured approach that can be adjusted as needed. This structure helps staff know their responsibilities clearly, which can be especially helpful during peak times or when training new employees.

## Why is it important to build cleaning into shift milestones like pre-open and post-close?

Integrating cleaning into shift milestones such as pre-open and post-close ensures that the restaurant maintains high standards of cleanliness from the moment it opens to closing. This routine helps in managing tasks systematically, preventing the build-up of tasks at the end of the day, and ensuring a clean and welcoming environment for both guests and staff.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning can be done at any time during the shift.**

Cleaning at random times can lead to important tasks being rushed or forgotten. Scheduled cleaning ensures every area is cleaned properly and ready for guests.

**Common misunderstanding: Pre-open and post-close cleaning is just about tidiness.**

These cleaning times are crucial for maintaining hygiene and safety standards, not just for appearances. They ensure that every new guest experiences a fresh environment and that health standards are upheld.

## How can I train new FOH staff to complete cleaning tasks correctly?

Training new front of house staff involves clear demonstrations, providing detailed checklists, and explaining the importance of each task. Use real scenarios to show the impact of good cleaning practices on guest satisfaction and safety. Regular feedback and follow-up training sessions can help reinforce these practices.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick run-through of tasks is sufficient training for new staff.**

New employees need thorough training to understand not just what to clean, but how to clean it effectively and why it’s important. This reduces errors and improves compliance with health standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Once trained, new staff don’t need further instruction.**

Ongoing training and regular updates are crucial as procedures change and as a refresher to maintain high standards. Continuous learning helps staff stay engaged and aware of their roles in maintaining cleanliness.
