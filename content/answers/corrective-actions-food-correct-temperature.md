# What corrective actions should be taken if food doesn't reach the correct temperature?

If food hasn't reached the correct temperature to be safe, you should continue cooking it until it reaches the required temperature and duration. It's important to use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the food. Make sure you follow these steps to ensure food safety and compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: If food hasn’t reached the correct temperature, it’s okay to serve it if it looks cooked.**

Looks can be deceiving. Even if food appears cooked, it might not be safe unless it reaches the temperature that kills harmful bacteria. Always use a thermometer to check.

**Common misunderstanding: You can just microwave undercooked food to quickly bring it to the right temperature.**

Microwaving can heat food unevenly, leading to some parts not reaching the necessary temperature. It's better to continue cooking using the original or a more reliable method.

## How can I safely cook food that didn't reach the correct temperature initially?

To safely bring food that hasn't reached the correct temperature up to standard, continue cooking it using the same or a more effective cooking method. Divide the food into smaller portions if necessary to speed up the process, and consistently monitor the temperature with a sanitised thermometer.

**Common misunderstanding: Turning up the heat will make the food safe faster.**

While higher heat might cook the exterior faster, it doesn’t guarantee the internal temperature will rise quickly enough to be safe. It’s better to cook at a steady, appropriate temperature.

## What should I do if equipment is faulty or broken during cooking?

If you discover that cooking equipment is faulty or broken, immediately stop using it. If possible, switch to alternative equipment that is functioning correctly. Always report the issue and, if necessary, call an engineer or maintenance team to repair or replace the faulty equipment.

**Common misunderstanding: A small fault in cooking equipment doesn’t affect the cooking process.**

Even minor faults can lead to uneven or insufficient heating, which may prevent food from reaching safe cooking temperatures. Always ensure equipment is in good working order.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to keep using the equipment until the end of the day before reporting it.**

Delaying the report of faulty equipment can lead to food safety risks or more extensive damage to the equipment. Report and cease using faulty equipment immediately.
