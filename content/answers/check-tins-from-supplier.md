When checking tins during delivery, you need to inspect them for several key things: Make sure there's no rust on the tins, check they aren't blown or bulging, verify there are no leaks or damage, and confirm all labels are intact and readable. It's also important to check that best before dates have at least 1 month remaining.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the tins are sealed, they are safe for consumption even if they have minor rust or dents.**

While sealed tins might appear safe, rust can indicate compromised metal integrity, which could lead to contamination. Dents, particularly if they are along the seams, can affect the seal, allowing bacteria to enter. Always prioritize food safety by rejecting any tins that show signs of rust or significant dents.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the best before date is unnecessary if the tins look fine.**

The best before date is a critical indicator of the product's quality. Even if tins appear in good condition, the contents may degrade over time, affecting taste and nutritional value. Ensuring at least one month remaining on the best before date helps maintain high standards for consumer satisfaction and safety.

## What happens if I find damaged tins in my delivery?

If you find any tins that don't meet these standards during delivery inspection, you should reject them immediately and contact your supplier. Make sure to clearly label these items as "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area away from other products until they can be returned or disposed of.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to use damaged tins as long as the contents don't seem spoiled.**

Using damaged tins is risky because even if contents appear normal, the damage can compromise the seal and allow harmful bacteria to enter. This can lead to foodborne illnesses. Always err on the side of caution by rejecting and returning damaged tins to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Damaged tins should be disposed of immediately to avoid any hassle with suppliers.**

It's important to document and report damaged tins to your supplier before disposal. This ensures accountability and may allow for a refund or replacement. Proper communication helps maintain the supply chain's integrity and can lead to improved quality control processes.

## How long can I leave tins sitting in the delivery area before putting them away?

While you should aim to transfer all deliveries to storage within 15 minutes of arrival, you have a maximum of 30 minutes in exceptional circumstances. However, remember that chilled items should always be prioritised first, followed by frozen goods, and then your ambient goods like tins can be dealt with last.

**Common misunderstanding: Ambient goods like tins can sit out indefinitely since they are not temperature-sensitive.**

While tins are more stable than perishable goods, prolonged exposure to fluctuating temperatures can still impact their quality. It's essential to transfer all items, including tins, to appropriate storage within 30 minutes to minimize the risk of environmental influences degrading the product.

**Common misunderstanding: It's acceptable to skip the delivery area check if you're in a hurry to store goods.**

Skipping the delivery check compromises food safety. Even if time is tight, it's crucial to inspect all deliveries for damage or other issues to prevent potential contamination or spoilage. Implementing a quick yet thorough inspection routine can save time and resources in the long run.
