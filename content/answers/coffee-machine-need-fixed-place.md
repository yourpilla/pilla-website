Yes, securing a coffee machine in place is crucial for safety and stability. Commercial coffee machines, especially those used in busy environments, should be fixed on a stable and robust surface to prevent any movement that could lead to accidents or damage.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s fine to place the coffee machine on any flat surface.**

While a flat surface is a start, the surface also needs to be durable and capable of handling the machine’s weight and vibration without shifting. This is particularly important in high-traffic areas where the machine could be accidentally bumped.

**Common misunderstanding: A coffee machine can be temporarily placed just about anywhere if it’s not being used often.**

Even if used infrequently, the machine should be properly installed to avoid any risks associated with instability or improper connections to power and water supplies.

## What’s the safest way to house a commercial espresso machine?

The safest way to house a commercial espresso machine is by placing it on a fixed, stable, and vibration-resistant counter that is specifically designed to support its weight and operational needs. Ensure the counter is also resistant to heat and moisture and is securely attached to the building’s structure.

**Common misunderstanding: Any commercial counter will support a coffee machine.**

Not all counters are suitable. The counter must be able to support the weight and withstand the heat and vibrations from the machine without warping or deteriorating over time.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the machine sits still, it doesn’t need extra securing.**

Securing the machine goes beyond just preventing movement during use; it also involves ensuring it’s safely connected to power and water supplies and won’t shift during cleaning or maintenance.

## Can I use a coffee machine on a movable counter or trolley?

Using a coffee machine on a movable counter or trolley is generally not recommended unless the trolley is specifically designed to securely hold the machine. If a movable platform is used, it must have locking mechanisms or brakes that ensure stability when the machine is in operation.

**Common misunderstanding: A trolley can be used if it feels sturdy.**

Feeling sturdy isn’t enough. The trolley must be designed to handle the specific weight and operational forces of the coffee machine, including features to lock it in place and prevent any movement.

**Common misunderstanding: Movable counters are a flexible option for all coffee machines.**

Flexibility can lead to safety issues. Movable counters may increase the risk of accidents if they shift or become unstable during use, especially under the weight and operational stress of commercial coffee machines.
