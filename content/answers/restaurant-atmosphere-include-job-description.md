# What should I include when describing my restaurant's atmosphere in a Restaurant Manager job description?

When writing a job description for a Restaurant Manager, start by clearly describing your restaurant's atmosphere. This helps potential candidates understand the environment they might be working in. Include details about the dining style, the pace of service, and the overall values of your establishment.

**Common misunderstanding: A detailed atmosphere description isn’t necessary in a job description.**

It's very important to describe the atmosphere because it sets expectations and attracts candidates who are a good fit. A clear description helps candidates decide if they would enjoy working in your restaurant's environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Any general description of the atmosphere will suffice.**

A generic description can lead to misaligned expectations. Be specific about what makes your restaurant unique, such as whether it's family-friendly, upscale, or fast-paced. This specificity helps in attracting the right candidates.

## How do I convey the style of service my restaurant offers in the job description?

To effectively convey the style of service, mention whether your restaurant offers fine dining, fast casual, or quick service. Describe how the staff interacts with customers and the pace of service, such as whether it’s relaxed or fast. This helps candidates understand the service expectations and the customer interaction they will manage.

**Common misunderstanding: The style of service is obvious from the restaurant type.**

Even within the same type of restaurant, service styles can vary greatly. Detailing whether your service is hands-on, formal, or quick can significantly influence a candidate's decision to apply.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed service style descriptions are not necessary if the restaurant is well-known.**

Even well-known restaurants should clearly outline their service style to ensure candidates are fully aware of what is expected. This reduces the risk of hiring someone who may not fit well with the service dynamics of the restaurant.

## What unique aspects of my restaurant should be highlighted to appeal to potential Restaurant Manager candidates?

Highlight aspects like your restaurant's commitment to sustainability, use of locally-sourced ingredients, or unique events such as wine-pairing nights. Mention any special service practices or team culture that make your restaurant a great place to work. This can attract candidates who are excited about these unique features and see a good fit with their own values and interests.

**Common misunderstanding: Unique features of the restaurant do not influence a manager’s job satisfaction.**

Managers often seek positions where they can align with the restaurant’s values and contribute to special features. Highlighting these can increase job satisfaction and attract candidates who are passionate about these aspects.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s enough to just mention that the restaurant is unique.**

Simply stating that the restaurant is unique is vague and uninformative. Provide specific examples of what makes your restaurant different from others, as this can be a major deciding factor for potential candidates.
