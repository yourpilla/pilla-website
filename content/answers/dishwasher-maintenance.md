# What regular maintenance should be done on a commercial dishwasher?

Regular maintenance of a commercial dishwasher is important to make sure it operates efficiently and maintains hygiene standards. Key maintenance tasks include checking and cleaning filters, spray arms, and seals. Running periodic cleaning cycles with specialised dishwasher cleaning agents helps prevent the buildup of food debris and residues. Manual scrubbing may be needed to remove biofilm, especially in hard water areas where scaling can happen.

**Common misunderstanding: Regular maintenance is only about fixing breakdowns.**

Maintenance isn't just about fixing problems as they occur; it's about preventing issues from arising. Regular checks and cleaning help keep the dishwasher in optimal condition, reducing the likelihood of breakdowns and ensuring cleanliness.

**Common misunderstanding: If the dishwasher looks clean, no further action is needed.**

Even if a dishwasher appears clean, biofilm and mineral deposits can build up in areas that are not visible. Regular maintenance routines are essential to address these problems and maintain hygiene standards.

## How often should filters, spray arms, and seals be cleaned?

Filters, spray arms, and seals in a commercial dishwasher should be checked and cleaned regularly to prevent clogging and ensure efficient operation. It's advisable to clean these parts at least once a week, depending on the usage and the level of soiling. In high-use environments, more frequent cleaning may be needed to maintain optimal performance.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning these parts once a month is enough.**

Cleaning just once a month can allow for the accumulation of grease and food particles, which can lead to inefficiencies and hygiene issues. Weekly cleaning is recommended to keep the dishwasher in top condition.

**Common misunderstanding: All parts of the dishwasher require the same level of attention.**

While regular maintenance is crucial, some parts like filters, spray arms, and seals require more frequent attention due to their direct role in the machine's cleaning effectiveness.

## What types of cleaning agents are recommended for dishwasher maintenance?

For maintaining a commercial dishwasher, use specialised dishwasher cleaning agents designed for deep cleaning and removing tough residues. These agents are formulated to deal with the types of soiling typical in commercial environments. In areas with hard water, using rinse aids and water softeners can help prevent scale buildup and increase cleaning efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: Any household cleaning agent can be used for commercial dishwashers.**

Household cleaning agents may not be effective enough for the heavy-duty requirements of commercial dishwashers. It's important to use cleaners specifically designed for commercial use to ensure thorough cleaning and sanitisation.

**Common misunderstanding: More cleaning agent means better cleaning.**

Using too much cleaning agent can actually lead to residue buildup. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for dosing to achieve the best results without wasting resources or harming the machine.
