# What is the correct wash temperature for a commercial dishwasher?

The correct wash temperature for a commercial dishwasher should be between 55-60°C. This range is crucial to ensure that the alkaline chemicals in detergents work effectively to break down and remove soiling from dishes, cutlery, and other kitchenware.

**Common misunderstanding: Any hot temperature is sufficient for a commercial dishwasher.**

Not all hot temperatures are effective. The specific range of 55-60°C is necessary to activate the cleaning chemicals properly and ensure they perform as intended.

**Common misunderstanding: Lower temperatures can be used if the dishwasher runs longer.**

Extending the dishwasher's run time does not compensate for the required temperature range. Lower temperatures fail to activate the detergents properly, leading to poor cleaning results.

## Why is maintaining 55-60°C important for effective cleaning?

Maintaining a temperature range of 55-60°C in a commercial dishwasher is essential for the effectiveness of the cleaning chemicals. At this temperature, the alkaline detergents are activated to efficiently break down grease, food residues, and other contaminants.

**Common misunderstanding: The temperature only affects the speed of cleaning.**

It's not just about speed; the temperature directly impacts the chemical reaction necessary for the detergents to work effectively. Without the correct temperature, these reactions do not occur efficiently, compromising the cleaning quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Higher temperatures than 60°C might improve cleaning efficiency.**

Exceeding 60°C can be as problematic as lower temperatures. It may lead to faster degradation of the equipment and excessive energy consumption without additional cleaning benefits.

## What happens if the wash temperature is too low?

If the wash temperature is too low, below 55°C, the detergents do not activate properly, leading to ineffective cleaning. This can result in dishes not being properly sanitised, posing a risk of harmful bacteria and pathogens surviving the wash cycle.

**Common misunderstanding: A low temperature wash is adequate for lightly soiled items.**

Even lightly soiled items require the minimum temperature to ensure all bacteria and residues are effectively removed. Lower temperatures might leave residues and bacteria on dishes.

**Common misunderstanding: If the dishwasher appears to clean well, temperature doesn’t matter.**

Visual cleanliness doesn't guarantee sanitisation. Proper temperatures are required to ensure all microorganisms are killed, not just visible soiling removed.
