There are several signs to look out for when checking if frozen food has gone bad. Look for grayish-brown leathery spots, which indicate freezer burn. While freezer burn doesn't make food unsafe, it can significantly affect quality. If there's slight freezer burn, you can cut away these areas before or after cooking. However, if the food is heavily freezer burnt, it's best to discard it.

Also, check if the food has been properly wrapped - food not securely wrapped in air-tight packaging is more likely to be compromised. The optimal freezer temperature should be -18°C (0°F) or below to maintain food quality.

**Common misunderstanding: If frozen food doesn't look or smell bad, it's safe to eat.**

While appearance and smell are indicators of food quality, they are not reliable measures of safety for frozen food. Harmful bacteria and pathogens can be present without altering the smell or appearance of the food. It's crucial to rely on proper storage practices and expiration dates to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezer burn makes frozen food unsafe to eat.**

Freezer burn affects the quality and texture of the food, not its safety. It occurs when air reaches the food's surface, causing dehydration and oxidation. While it might make the food less palatable, it's still safe to consume. However, if the quality is severely compromised, it is advisable to discard the affected portions.

## What happens if frozen food starts to defrost and then is refrozen?

You should never refreeze defrosted food. If food has begun to defrost (becoming soft with melting ice), it needs to be moved to a fridge for controlled defrosting and used within 48 hours. If the food has fully defrosted and become warm, it must be discarded.

For items like ice cream that must remain frozen at all times, if they've defrosted they need to be discarded immediately - they cannot be refrozen.

**Common misunderstanding: Refreezing defrosted food is safe if it hasn't been left out for too long.**

Refreezing defrosted food can compromise food safety, as the thawing process allows bacteria to multiply. Even if the food appears fine and hasn't been out for long, the risk of bacterial growth increases. It's essential to cook defrosted food before considering refreezing to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: You can refreeze ice cream if it's only partially melted.**

Ice cream that has melted, even partially, should not be refrozen. The thawing process can alter its texture and lead to the growth of bacteria, making it unsafe. Once melted, it's best to discard ice cream to avoid the risk of food-borne illnesses.

## How long can I keep food in the freezer before it goes bad?

For items like batch-cooked foods, they should be properly wrapped, labeled with the production date, and used within one month. Fresh meat should ideally not be frozen, but if necessary, it should be adequately wrapped, date labeled, and also used within one month.

The key is proper wrapping and storage - food should be portioned out and thoroughly wrapped or stored in adequate containers before freezing. Always label with production dates and any allergen information.

**Common misunderstanding: All frozen foods can be stored indefinitely without any loss of quality.**

While frozen foods can be stored for extended periods at 0°F or below, their quality can deteriorate over time. Factors such as freezer burn, changes in texture, and flavour loss can occur. It's advisable to use batch-cooked foods and fresh meat within one month to ensure optimal quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Properly wrapped frozen food never goes bad.**

Even with proper wrapping, frozen food can eventually degrade in quality. Wrapping helps minimize freezer burn and dehydration, but it does not halt the gradual loss of taste and texture over time. It's important to follow recommended storage durations to maintain food quality.
