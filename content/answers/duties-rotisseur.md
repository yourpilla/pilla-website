# What are the duties of a Rotisseur?

The Rotisseur, also known as the Roast Chef, is primarily responsible for roasting meats and vegetables and preparing appropriate sauces to accompany these dishes. This chef ensures that meat cuts are properly prepared, selects suitable oils and spices to enhance the flavours, and delivers perfectly roasted dishes that meet the restaurant's high standards. Their role is crucial for maintaining the quality of the restaurant’s dishes.

**Common misunderstanding: The Rotisseur only handles meat.**

While the Rotisseur specialises in roasting meats, their duties also extend to roasting vegetables and preparing sauces that complement the main dishes. This broadens their impact on the menu and the dining experience.

**Common misunderstanding: The Rotisseur’s job is simple since it only involves roasting.**

Roasting is a complex cooking technique that requires precise timing, temperature control, and a deep understanding of how flavours develop. The Rotisseur plays a key role in ensuring these elements are perfectly executed to produce high-quality dishes.

## What cooking methods does a Roast Chef use?

The Rotisseur employs various cooking methods, including grilling, smoking, and braising. These techniques help in achieving different textures and depths of flavour in the dishes they prepare. For instance, grilling can impart a charred, smoky flavour to meats, while braising is excellent for making tougher cuts tender and flavourful.

**Common misunderstanding: Roasting and grilling are the same.**

Roasting typically involves cooking food in an oven using indirect heat, which allows it to cook evenly on all sides. Grilling, used by the Rotisseur for certain dishes, involves direct heat and usually results in a sear that adds flavour and texture.

**Common misunderstanding: Smoking is only for flavour.**

While smoking adds a distinctive flavour, it’s also a cooking method that can tenderise meats by breaking down tougher proteins over long cooking periods. The Rotisseur uses this method to enhance both the taste and texture of the dishes.

## How does the Rotisseur contribute to the menu?

The Rotisseur significantly influences the menu by creating dishes that showcase their expertise in roasting and cooking meats and vegetables. They work closely with the Head Chef to develop recipes that align with the restaurant's culinary direction and customer preferences. Their creations often become signature dishes that highlight the restaurant's quality and creativity.

**Common misunderstanding: The Rotisseur’s contributions are limited to individual dishes.**

The Rotisseur’s work impacts the overall dining experience by providing expertly cooked main components that pair with sides and sauces, contributing to the cohesive flow of the menu.

**Common misunderstanding: The Rotisseur does not participate in menu planning.**

Although the Head Chef typically leads menu planning, the Rotisseur plays an integral role by suggesting new dishes and modifications based on their specialised knowledge of roasting and cooking techniques.
