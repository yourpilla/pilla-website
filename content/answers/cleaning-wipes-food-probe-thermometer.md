No, you shouldn't use regular cleaning wipes on your probe thermometer. Instead, you need to follow a specific two-step cleaning and sanitising process:

1\. First wash the probe with warm soapy water to remove dirt and debris, then rinse with clean water

2\. After cleaning, sanitise the probe using either alcohol swabs or a bleach solution to eliminate any remaining germs or allergens

This proper cleaning method helps prevent cross-contamination and ensures accurate temperature readings.

**Common misunderstanding: Using regular cleaning wipes is sufficient for sanitising food probe thermometers.**

Regular cleaning wipes often lack the necessary sanitising agents to effectively kill bacteria and other pathogens. For thorough sanitisation, it is crucial to use alcohol swabs or a bleach solution, which are proven to eliminate germs effectively. This is essential to prevent cross-contamination and ensure food safety.

## How often should I clean my probe thermometer?

You should clean and sanitise your probe thermometer before each use. This ensures that when the probe goes into the next food item, it's completely clean and won't transfer any contaminants or allergens between different foods.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning the probe thermometer once at the end of the day is adequate.**

Cleaning the probe thermometer only once at the end of the day is insufficient. Each use can introduce new bacteria, which can transfer between foods, leading to potential cross-contamination. It is critical to clean and sanitise the probe before each use to maintain hygiene and ensure accurate temperature readings.

## What other maintenance should I do to keep my probe working correctly?

Beyond cleaning, you should:

-   Never leave the probe in extreme temperatures (like fridges, freezers, or ovens)
-   Avoid immersing it in liquids
-   Store it in its protective case when not in use
-   Replace batteries regularly
-   Regularly check for any damage like bent probes or cracked displays
