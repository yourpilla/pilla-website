Martyn's Law, officially known as the Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Act 2025, is a UK legislation designed to enhance security in public venues to prepare for and mitigate terrorist attacks. It was introduced in response to several terrorist incidents in the UK, aiming to ensure that venues are better prepared to protect the public.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn's Law applies to all businesses across the UK.**

Martyn's Law specifically targets public premises that meet certain size thresholds, focusing on venues where large crowds gather, such as restaurants, hotels, and nightclubs. It does not apply to all businesses.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance with Martyn's Law is optional.**

Compliance with Martyn's Law is mandatory for venues that fall within its scope. These venues must take defined steps to prepare for and respond to terrorist threats, with enforcement measures in place for non-compliance.

## Who was Martyn Hett and how did he influence this law?

Martyn Hett was one of the 22 victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. His mother, Figen Murray, became a key advocate for improved security measures at public venues, which led to the development of Martyn's Law. This law was named in his memory to honor his life and the campaign led by his mother to prevent future tragedies.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn's Law was solely the government's initiative.**

While the government did enact the law, it was significantly influenced by public advocacy, particularly by Martyn Hett's mother, who campaigned tirelessly for better security measures at public venues after her son's death.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn's Law focuses only on preventing bombings.**

Martyn's Law is comprehensive, addressing various forms of terrorist threats, not just bombings. It includes measures to prepare for different types of attacks, ensuring a broad scope of protection.

## What major events led to the creation of Martyn’s Law?

The creation of Martyn’s Law was primarily triggered by the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, where 22 people were killed, including Martyn Hett. This tragic event highlighted the vulnerabilities in public venue security and spurred a public demand for stricter regulations. Subsequent terrorist attacks in the UK further underscored the need for legislation like Martyn’s Law.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn’s Law was a quick response to a single event.**

The development of Martyn's Law was not an immediate reaction to just one incident but was the result of years of campaigning, public consultations, and legislative processes following several terrorist attacks.

**Common misunderstanding: The law was implemented immediately after the Manchester Arena attack.**

It took several years of development, consultation, and legislative processes before Martyn's Law was formally enacted in 2025, reflecting the complexity and importance of getting such a law right.
