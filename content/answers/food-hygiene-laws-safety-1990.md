  other crucial regulations to ensure high levels of food safety and hygiene.
---
Alongside the Food Safety Act 1990, several other laws help ensure food safety in the UK. These include the General Food Law Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and the Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013. These laws complement the Food Safety Act by setting additional standards and requirements for food businesses to maintain high levels of food safety and hygiene.

**Common misunderstanding: The Food Safety Act 1990 is the only law that food businesses need to comply with.**

This isn't true. While the Food Safety Act 1990 is fundamental, other regulations like the General Food Law Regulation and the Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations also play crucial roles in ensuring comprehensive food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Once compliant with the Food Safety Act 1990, no further action is required.**

Compliance with the Food Safety Act 1990 is just the beginning. Food businesses must also adhere to other specific hygiene and safety regulations to fully protect public health and meet legal standards.

## How does the General Food Law Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 support food safety?

The General Food Law Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 is an important piece of legislation that supports food safety by setting out the general principles of food safety and traceability. It focuses on preventing unsafe food from reaching consumers and ensures that all food businesses operate under strict safety protocols. This regulation also emphasises the importance of traceability, allowing for quick action if food safety issues arise.

**Common misunderstanding: The General Food Law Regulation is only about food traceability.**

While traceability is a significant aspect, the regulation also covers a wide range of food safety management practices, including risk assessment and control measures to prevent contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: This regulation applies only to food producers.**

Actually, the General Food Law Regulation applies to all stages of the food supply chain, from production to distribution, ensuring comprehensive food safety coverage.

## What do the Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013 require from food businesses?

The Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013 require food businesses to meet specific hygiene standards. These regulations detail the necessary practices for cleaning, pest control, and proper food handling. They also enforce the implementation of food safety management systems based on HACCP principles, which help identify, evaluate, and control hazards that are significant for food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: These regulations are optional for small food businesses.**

All food businesses, regardless of size, must comply with these regulations to ensure food is safe for consumption and free from contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance with these regulations guarantees no food safety issues.**

While compliance significantly reduces the risk of food safety issues, ongoing vigilance, regular training, and updates to procedures are necessary to continually protect consumers.
