Preparing for Martyn's Law involves understanding the law's requirements and implementing necessary measures to ensure compliance. Start by assessing if your venue falls within the scope of the law, then develop or update your emergency procedures, conduct staff training, and ensure documentation is in place. It's crucial to begin these steps well before the law is enforced to ensure a smooth transition.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn's Law only applies to large venues.**

While larger venues have more extensive requirements under Martyn's Law, many smaller venues that can host 200 or more people at one time also need to comply. It's important to check your venue's capacity and understand the specific obligations for your size category.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance with Martyn's Law is optional.**

Compliance with Martyn's Law is mandatory for all venues that meet the specified criteria. Non-compliance can lead to significant penalties, including fines and potential closure of the venue.

It's advisable that all businesses (even except businesses) carry out a terrorism risk assessment and staff training at a minimum.

## How do you assess whether your venue is in scope?

To determine if your venue is in scope for Martyn's Law, check if your venue type and capacity meet the criteria set out in the law. Venues that expect 200 or more people at one time, including staff and customers, are generally in scope. This includes restaurants, bars, hotels, and other public venues. Assessing your venue's status is the first step in preparing for compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: Only venues that regularly host large events are in scope.**

Even if large gatherings are infrequent, venues that have the capacity to host 200 or more people at one time must comply. It's about potential capacity, not just regular usage.

**Common misunderstanding: All hospitality venues need to comply regardless of size.**

Smaller venues that cannot host 200 people at one time are generally not in scope, unless they host occasional events that push their capacity over this threshold.

## How can you conduct a terrorism risk assessment?

Conducting a terrorism risk assessment involves evaluating potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to your venue. Identify how an attacker could exploit your venue and assess the impact of different attack scenarios. This assessment forms the basis of your security planning and helps in developing effective emergency procedures.

**Common misunderstanding: A terrorism risk assessment needs to be extremely detailed and technical.**

While thoroughness is important, the risk assessment should be practical and manageable. Focus on clear, identifiable risks and straightforward mitigation strategies that can be easily implemented and understood by your staff.

**Common misunderstanding: Once done, a risk assessment does not need to be revisited.**

Risk assessments should be updated regularly, especially if there are changes to the venue or new threats are identified. Continuous review ensures that your security measures remain relevant and effective.
