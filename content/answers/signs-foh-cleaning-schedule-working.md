When your front of house (FOH) looks clean but customers or staff start noticing issues, it might mean your cleaning schedule needs a check. Look for signs like tasks being skipped, complaints about cleanliness, or visible dirt on supposedly clean surfaces. These are red flags that your current system isn't keeping up.

**Common misunderstanding: If no one complains, the cleaning must be fine.**

Just because guests aren't voicing complaints doesn't mean all is well. Regularly check high-traffic areas and touchpoints yourself. Small signs like sticky menus or dusty seats can indicate bigger issues.

**Common misunderstanding: A checklist is completed, so everything must be clean.**

Even if a checklist is marked as complete, it doesn't guarantee the tasks were done properly. Regular spot checks and following up on the quality of completed tasks are crucial to ensure standards are maintained.

## How should managers follow up when FOH cleaning tasks are missed or done poorly?

Managers need to be proactive when cleaning tasks are missed or not up to standard. Start by discussing the issue with the responsible staff to understand why it happened. Was it a lack of time, resources, or understanding? Then, retrain or clarify the task as needed and monitor to ensure improvement.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s enough to just remind staff to do better next time.**

Simply reminding staff isn't effective without addressing the root cause of the missed task. Provide additional training or resources if needed, and adjust schedules to give staff enough time to complete their tasks.

**Common misunderstanding: Only retrain staff when there are repeated mistakes.**

Addressing issues at the first sign of trouble can prevent bad habits from taking hold. Immediate feedback and correction help maintain high standards and show the importance of each task.

## What corrective actions can be taken when FOH hygiene standards slip?

If you notice a drop in hygiene standards, immediate corrective actions are necessary. These might include re-cleaning the area, retraining the staff member involved, and reviewing and possibly revising the cleaning schedule to prevent future lapses. Ensure all tools and supplies are available and in good condition to support the staff's cleaning efforts.

**Common misunderstanding: Corrective actions are only about fixing the immediate problem.**

While immediate fixes are necessary, long-term solutions like adjusting the cleaning schedule or increasing training sessions are also important to prevent future issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Punishing staff will improve cleaning standards.**

Punishment can create a negative atmosphere and may not address the underlying issues. Focus on support, training, and providing the right tools for the job to improve standards effectively.
