No, you should not accept deliveries that are close to their use-by dates. When checking deliveries, use-by dates must have a minimum of 5 days usage remaining. For best-before dates, you need at least 1 month remaining.

This ensures you have adequate time to use the products safely while maintaining food quality standards. If products don't meet these date requirements, you should reject them and contact your supplier.

**Common misunderstanding: Use-by dates are just suggestions, and it's safe to use products past this date as long as they look and smell fine.**

Use-by dates are critical for safety, especially for perishable items. Consuming products past their use-by date can pose serious health risks, as these dates are determined based on safety assessments. Unlike best-before dates, which relate to quality, use-by dates are crucial for ensuring the product is safe to consume.

**Common misunderstanding: If the supplier assures the quality of the product despite the nearing use-by date, it is safe to accept the delivery.**

Regardless of supplier assurances, you should adhere strictly to use-by date guidelines to avoid health risks. The supplier's assurance does not mitigate the potential for foodborne illnesses that can arise from consuming products past their safe consumption period.

## What if the supplier offers me a discount on short-dated items?

Even with a discount, you should still reject items that don't meet the minimum date requirements. This is a food safety standard, not a cost consideration. Accepting short-dated stock increases the risk of having to dispose of unused items and could potentially compromise food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Discounted short-dated items are a cost-saving opportunity, especially if the volume is low.**

While discounts may appear to offer cost savings, the potential waste from spoiled products can negate these savings. Furthermore, the risk of compromising food safety and incurring possible legal liabilities or damaging your brand's reputation far outweighs any initial savings from discounted short-dated stock.

**Common misunderstanding: Short-dated items can be safely used if stored correctly immediately after purchase.**

Proper storage may extend the life of certain products, but it does not negate the risk associated with consuming items close to or past their use-by dates. These dates are established to ensure safety, and using items beyond this period can still pose health risks, regardless of storage conditions.

## What should I do if I notice the short dates after the delivery driver has left?

If you discover products with insufficient use-by dates after the delivery has been completed, you should immediately label these items as "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area away from other products. Contact your supplier right away to arrange return or disposal.

**Common misunderstanding: If short-dated items are discovered after delivery, they can be used quickly to avoid waste.**

Using short-dated items immediately may seem like a solution to avoid waste, but it still poses a risk to food safety. It's crucial to follow protocol by labelling these items as 'not for consumption' and contacting the supplier for resolution. This ensures compliance with food safety standards and protects your customers from potential health risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the delivery driver has left, there's nothing you can do about short-dated items.**

Even after the delivery driver has left, you have actionable options. You should promptly label and segregate the items and contact the supplier to address the issue. Documenting the incident ensures accountability and helps prevent future occurrences. Effective supplier communication and documentation are key to resolving such issues efficiently.
