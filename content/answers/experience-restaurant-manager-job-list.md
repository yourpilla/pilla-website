# What levels of experience are appropriate to list in a Restaurant Manager job description?

When writing a job description for a Restaurant Manager, it's important to clearly define the level of experience needed. This can range from trainee positions, which are open to nurturing someone without managerial experience, to senior roles requiring extensive experience in managing high-volume, quality-oriented restaurants.

**Common misunderstanding: More years of experience always means a better candidate.**

It's not just about the number of years; it's about the relevance and quality of the experience. A candidate with fewer years but highly relevant experience might be more suitable than someone with many years in a less relevant role.

**Common misunderstanding: Any type of management experience is suitable.**

Specific experience related to restaurant management is crucial. Experience in unrelated fields, while valuable, might not provide the necessary skills for managing a restaurant effectively.

## Should I prioritise practical experience over years of service in a Restaurant Manager role?

Yes, prioritising practical experience over just the number of years worked can be more beneficial. Practical experience provides clear evidence of a candidate's ability to handle the specific challenges of a restaurant environment, such as managing a busy kitchen, dealing with customer service issues, and leading a team effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: Years of service is the best indicator of a candidate’s ability.**

While years of service can indicate dedication, it doesn't necessarily reflect a candidate's competence or success in specific managerial tasks within a restaurant setting.

**Common misunderstanding: All management experience is the same.**

Different management roles require different skills. Managing a retail store, for example, involves different challenges than managing a restaurant. It's important to look for experience that directly relates to the restaurant industry.

## How do I specify the type of environment the experience should be in for a Restaurant Manager?

Be specific about the type of restaurant environment when listing experience requirements in a job description. This could include whether the experience should be in a fast-paced, high-turnover setting, a fine dining environment, or a family-style restaurant. Detailing the type of service, such as casual dining, buffet, or a la carte, can also help attract candidates with the most relevant background.

**Common misunderstanding: Any hospitality experience is suitable.**

Not all hospitality experience will equip a candidate for the specific demands of a restaurant manager role. Experience in hotel management or event catering, for example, while valuable, might not directly translate to the day-to-day demands of restaurant management.

**Common misunderstanding: The size of the previous restaurant isn’t important.**

The scale of operations can greatly affect the relevance of experience. Managing a small cafe is different from managing a large, busy restaurant. Specify if the experience should be in managing similar-sized or larger operations than your own.
