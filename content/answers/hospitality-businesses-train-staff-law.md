# How should hospitality businesses train staff under Martyn's Law?

Under Martyn's Law, hospitality businesses must ensure their staff are well-trained to respond to terrorism threats. This involves comprehensive training that covers both awareness of suspicious behaviours and specific emergency procedures. The training should be regular and updated to keep pace with current threats, ensuring all staff from managers to front-line workers understand their roles during an emergency.

**Common misunderstanding: Training is only necessary for security staff.**

All staff members, not just security personnel, need training under Martyn's Law. This includes servers, bartenders, housekeeping, and management. Everyone should know what to do in an emergency to ensure guest and staff safety.

**Common misunderstanding: A one-time training session is sufficient.**

Training should be ongoing. Martyn's Law requires that training is refreshed regularly to address new threats and changes in procedures. This ensures that all staff members are always prepared.

## What training should be given for suspicious behaviour awareness?

Training for suspicious behaviour awareness under Martyn's Law should teach staff how to spot signs of potential threats and what actions to take. This includes identifying unattended bags, individuals showing signs of nervousness or being overdressed for the weather, and any unusual behaviour. Staff should also learn how to report their observations effectively and discreetly to prevent panic and ensure a coordinated response.

**Common misunderstanding: Suspicious behaviour is always obvious.**

Suspicious behaviour can often be subtle. Training helps staff to notice less obvious signs and understand that it's better to report something minor than miss a serious threat.

**Common misunderstanding: Reporting every suspicious behaviour will alarm guests.**

Staff can be trained to report discreetly, using coded messages or direct communication with security personnel or management, minimizing guest alarm while ensuring safety.

## What procedural training is needed for emergencies?

Procedural training under Martyn's Law involves preparing staff to respond effectively to an emergency situation. This includes evacuation, invacuation (moving to a safe area within the premises), and lockdown procedures. Staff should know all emergency exits and safe areas, understand how to communicate during an emergency, and be familiar with the use of any security equipment like alarms or communication devices.

**Common misunderstanding: Evacuation is always the best response to a threat.**

Depending on the nature of the threat, evacuation might not be safe. Training should cover different scenarios, including when to lockdown or invacuate, which can be crucial for safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Procedural training is the same as general emergency training.**

While there are similarities, procedural training under Martyn's Law focuses specifically on terrorist threats, which may require different responses compared to other emergencies like fires.
