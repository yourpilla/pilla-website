# How often should a commercial coffee machine be serviced?

It's important to service your commercial coffee machine regularly to keep it running smoothly and safely. The frequency of servicing should follow the manufacturer's recommendations, which is typically every 3 to 6 months depending on usage. Regular servicing helps prevent issues like leaks, pressure problems, and electrical faults.

**Common misunderstanding: Servicing can be done only when the machine seems to be malfunctioning.**

Waiting until there are visible problems can lead to bigger, more costly issues or even safety hazards. Regular, scheduled servicing is necessary to maintain the machine's safety and efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: Daily cleaning is enough to keep the machine in good working order.**

While daily cleaning is crucial, it does not replace the need for professional servicing, which checks deeper mechanical and safety aspects of the machine.

## Who should service a commercial espresso machine?

A qualified technician who has experience with commercial coffee equipment should service your espresso machine. This ensures that servicing is done correctly and safely. Using certified professionals helps maintain the machine's warranty and ensures compliance with health and safety regulations.

**Common misunderstanding: Any general maintenance person can service a coffee machine.**

Commercial coffee machines are complex and require specific knowledge for proper maintenance. Only use technicians who are trained to handle the specific model and type of your coffee machine.

**Common misunderstanding: In-house staff can perform the same servicing as professionals.**

While in-house staff can perform basic maintenance and daily cleaning, professional servicing involves detailed checks and calibrations that require specialised knowledge and tools.

## What records do I need to keep for coffee machine maintenance?

You should keep detailed records of all servicing and maintenance activities. These records should include the date of service, the technician's name, the services performed, and any parts replaced. It's also wise to keep a log of daily cleaning and any minor maintenance tasks performed by staff.

**Common misunderstanding: Keeping maintenance records is only necessary for large businesses.**

Every business, regardless of size, should keep maintenance records to ensure safety, comply with health regulations, and maintain the machine's warranty.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital records are not necessary if you keep physical copies.**

Digital records are easier to manage, back up, and retrieve when needed. They are also more durable than paper records, which can be lost or damaged.
