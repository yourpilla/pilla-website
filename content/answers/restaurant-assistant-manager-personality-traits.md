# What personality traits should I add to a Restaurant Assistant Manager job description?

When writing a job description for a Restaurant Assistant Manager, it's important to include personality traits that align with your restaurant's culture and operational style. Consider traits like proactive engagement, innovative thinking, and effective communication. These traits help ensure the candidate fits well with your team and can handle the responsibilities of the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Any positive traits are good to list in a job description.**

Not all positive traits are suitable for every role. It's important to choose traits that specifically match the needs and culture of your restaurant. For example, a high-energy, fast-paced restaurant might need someone who thrives under pressure, whereas a family-style restaurant might look for someone with a nurturing and patient personality.

**Common misunderstanding: Listing many traits will attract more candidates.**

Listing too many traits can be overwhelming and may deter qualified candidates who feel they might not meet all the listed criteria. It's better to focus on a few key traits that are crucial for the role.

## How can I describe traits without using clichés like "team player"?

Instead of using clichés, describe traits through specific actions or behaviors that illustrate how those traits manifest in the workplace. For example, instead of saying "team player," you might say, "collaborates effectively with both kitchen and front-of-house staff to ensure smooth service." This gives a clearer picture of what you expect and how these traits contribute to your restaurant's success.

**Common misunderstanding: Clichés are easy for everyone to understand, so they're okay to use.**

While clichés are commonly understood, they don't provide clear expectations. Specific descriptions help candidates better understand the role and self-assess their fit for your team.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed trait descriptions make the job description too long and complex.**

Effective descriptions can be concise and clear. Focus on how these traits apply in day-to-day operations rather than providing a lengthy explanation. This keeps your job description to the point while still being informative.

## What specific qualities are needed to match my restaurant's pace and service style?

The qualities you look for should directly reflect your restaurant’s pace and service style. For a fast-paced environment, qualities like quick decision-making, resilience, and efficient problem-solving are important. For a fine dining setting, look for attention to detail, a calm demeanor, and a passion for providing an exceptional guest experience. Tailor these qualities to fit the unique challenges and expectations of your restaurant.

**Common misunderstanding: All restaurants need the same type of assistant manager.**

Each restaurant has its unique atmosphere and operational style, which means the qualities needed in an assistant manager can vary greatly. Understanding your specific needs helps in finding the right candidate.

**Common misunderstanding: High qualifications and experience are enough, without focusing on specific personal qualities.**

While experience and qualifications are important, the personal qualities of an assistant manager can greatly influence how well they can adapt to and thrive in your specific restaurant environment. These qualities often determine their effectiveness in the role and their ability to maintain your restaurant’s service standards.
