# What is the role of the Entremétier?

The Entremétier, also known as the Vegetable Chef, plays a important role in a professional kitchen by focusing on vegetable dishes, soups, and egg-based recipes. This chef ensures that all vegetable sides and vegetarian dishes are prepared with care and expertise, contributing to the overall balance and nutritional value of the meal.

**Common misunderstanding: The Entremétier only prepares side dishes.**

While vegetable dishes are a significant part of the Entremétier's responsibilities, they also manage soups and egg-based dishes, which can be central to a meal, especially in vegetarian cuisine.

**Common misunderstanding: The Entremétier's role is less skilled and important than other chefs.**

The skills required to master the preparation of vegetables, soups, and egg dishes are complex and varied, making the Entremétier's role both skilled and essential for the diversity and quality of the menu.

## What dishes is a Vegetable Chef responsible for?

Entremétiers do much more than just prepare raw vegetables; they cook and season them, and often combine them with other ingredients to create complex dishes.
