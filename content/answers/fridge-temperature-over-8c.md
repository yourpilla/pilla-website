If you find a fridge temperature over 8°C, you need to take immediate action:

1.  First, check the actual food temperature using a clean, sanitised probe thermometer
2.  Move all high-risk foods to another working fridge if possible
3.  If you can't move the food, you must use it within 4 hours of it being above 8°C
4.  Any food that's been above 8°C for more than 4 hours must be thrown away
5.  Mark the fridge temperature task as an issue in your Pilla app and document all actions taken in the comments section

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the fridge door remains closed, the temperature inside will quickly return to safe levels after a brief rise above 8°C.**

While keeping the fridge door closed can help maintain the internal temperature, it does not guarantee a quick return to safe levels if the temperature has risen above 8°C. Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures can still occur, risking food safety. Always check actual food temperatures and follow protocols to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: If the fridge temperature rises above 8°C, it is safe to consume the food as long as it looks and smells fine.**

Visual and olfactory checks are not reliable methods for determining food safety. Harmful bacteria can multiply rapidly at temperatures above 8°C, even if the food appears normal. It's crucial to adhere to temperature guidelines and discard any food that has been at unsafe temperatures for over 4 hours.

## What if I'm not sure how long the fridge has been broken?

If you're unsure how long the fridge has been faulty (for example, if it broke down overnight), you should discard all the food and record it as waste. It's better to be safe than risk serving potentially dangerous food. Make sure to document this in Pilla with detailed comments about why the food was discarded.

**Common misunderstanding: If the fridge was only slightly warm when checked, the food inside is likely still safe to use.**

The warmth of the fridge at the time of discovery does not accurately reflect how long the food may have been exposed to unsafe temperatures. Without knowing the exact duration of the breakdown, it's safer to discard the food to prevent food-borne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the fridge is fixed quickly, the food inside can be salvaged and safely consumed.**

Repairing the fridge does not reverse the effects of prolonged exposure to unsafe temperatures. Once food has been exposed to temperatures above the safe threshold for an unknown period, it must be discarded, regardless of subsequent repairs.

## What about fresh fish that's in a broken fridge?

Fresh fish requires special handling - it must be stored below 3°C at all times. If you find fresh fish stored above 3°C in a broken fridge, it must be discarded immediately, regardless of how long it's been at that temperature. This is stricter than the rules for other foods because fresh fish is particularly sensitive to temperature changes.
