Food should only be reheated once. After it has been cooked and cooled, if you reheat it, do not cool it and reheat it again. This is to ensure the food remains safe to eat and reduces the risk of food-borne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: You can reheat food as many times as you like as long as you reach the right temperature.**

Even if food is reheated to the correct temperature, reheating multiple times can still pose a risk. Each cycle of cooling and reheating can increase the chance of harmful bacteria surviving and multiplying.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheating food multiple times is safe if the food smells and looks fine.**

The absence of a bad smell or visible spoilage does not guarantee that food is safe to eat. Bacteria and toxins that cause food poisoning do not always affect the smell, taste, or appearance of food.

## Why should food never be reheated more than once?

Reheating food more than once significantly increases the risk of food poisoning. Each time food is cooled and reheated, it passes through the "danger zone" (5°C to 63°C), where bacteria can multiply rapidly. Reheating multiple times can allow these bacteria to reach levels that are not safe.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to reheat food multiple times if you’re careful with handling.**

Even with careful handling, reheating food multiple times can still allow bacteria to grow. The risk increases each time food passes through the danger zone.

**Common misunderstanding: Multiple reheating cycles won’t affect the food if the intervals are short.**

Short intervals between reheating cycles do not reduce the risk of bacteria growth. Each time food is reheated, it must pass through temperatures that are ideal for bacteria to thrive.

## What are the dangers of reheating and cooling food multiple times?

Reheating and cooling food multiple times can lead to increased bacterial growth, including the production of toxins and spores. These bacteria can cause food poisoning and other health risks. Each cycle through the danger zone increases these risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooling food quickly after reheating makes it safe to reheat again.**

Quick cooling does not remove the bacteria that may have multiplied during the reheating process. These bacteria can remain in the food and become harmful when the food is reheated again.

**Common misunderstanding: If food is reheated to a high enough temperature, any bacteria present will be killed.**

While reheating to the correct temperature can kill many bacteria, it does not eliminate all toxins or spores that might have been produced by bacteria during previous cooling and reheating cycles.
