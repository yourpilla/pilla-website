If your hospitality venue, such as a restaurant, bar, or hotel, has a capacity of 200–799 people at any one time, it falls under the Standard Tier of Martyn's Law. This means you need to take specific actions to prepare for potential terrorist threats. These actions include registering your venue with the Security Industry Authority (SIA), developing a terrorism response plan, and ensuring your staff are trained on this plan.

**Common misunderstanding: Only large venues need to comply with Martyn's Law.**

Even venues with a capacity as low as 200 people are required to comply with the Standard Tier requirements of Martyn's Law. It's not just large venues that need to be prepared.

**Common misunderstanding: Standard Tier requirements involve expensive physical security upgrades.**

The law does not mandate costly physical security measures for Standard Tier venues. The focus is on procedural readiness and staff training, which are more about planning and preparation than financial investment.

## What is a terrorism response plan (public protection procedure)?

A terrorism response plan, also known as public protection procedures, is a detailed plan that outlines what actions staff should take in the event of a terrorist attack. This plan should include procedures for evacuation, invacuation (sheltering in place), lockdown, and communication during the crisis. The aim is to ensure that everyone on the premises knows exactly what to do to stay safe until help arrives.

**Common misunderstanding: A terrorism response plan is only for high-risk areas.**

Regardless of location, any venue that meets the size criteria under Martyn's Law must have a terrorism response plan. Terrorism can occur anywhere, so preparedness is crucial everywhere.

**Common misunderstanding: The plan only needs to be written and not practiced.**

Having a written plan is important, but it's equally important that staff are familiar with it and practice it through drills. This ensures everyone knows their role and actions during an actual emergency.

## What staff training is needed under Martyn’s Law?

Under Martyn's Law, staff training is essential to ensure that all employees are aware of the terrorism response plan and understand their roles in an emergency. Training should cover how to identify suspicious behavior, the use of emergency equipment, evacuation routes, and communication methods. Regular drills and refresher courses are recommended to keep the information fresh and to account for new staff members.

**Common misunderstanding: Only security personnel need terrorism response training.**

All staff members, not just security teams, need training under Martyn's Law. This includes servers, bartenders, receptionists, and housekeeping staff, as everyone plays a role in emergency response.

**Common misunderstanding: Training is a one-time requirement.**

Training should be an ongoing process with regular updates and drills to ensure all staff are prepared and new employees are brought up to speed. This continuous training helps maintain a high level of readiness.
