# How do I evaluate risks during a kitchen risk assessment?

When you're assessing risks in the kitchen, think about how likely it is that someone could get hurt and how serious the injury could be. This helps you decide which risks need the most attention and what actions you should take to prevent accidents.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchen hazards need to be eliminated.**

It's not always possible to eliminate every hazard in a kitchen. The goal is to manage risks so that the kitchen is as safe as possible. Focus on reducing the likelihood of accidents and minimizing their potential impact.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick walk-through is enough for a risk assessment.**

Effective risk evaluation requires a thorough review during different kitchen operations, not just a quick check. Observe during busy times, such as during service, as well as quieter times, to get a complete picture of potential risks.

## What questions should I ask to evaluate kitchen risks?

To effectively evaluate kitchen risks, ask specific questions like: How likely is it that someone could be harmed by this hazard? If something goes wrong, how severe could the injury be? These questions help you prioritize risks and focus on preventing the most serious accidents.

**Common misunderstanding: Only consider risks that have previously resulted in accidents.**

Don't just focus on past incidents. Consider potential hazards that haven't yet caused problems but could lead to serious injuries. This proactive approach helps prevent accidents before they occur.

**Common misunderstanding: Risk evaluation is only about immediate dangers.**

Include long-term risks in your evaluation, such as prolonged exposure to noise or harmful substances. These might not cause immediate injuries but can lead to serious health issues over time.

## How do I decide if existing controls are enough?

Review the current measures in place to manage risks and decide if they're sufficient. Consider if the controls effectively reduce the risk of harm and if they're being consistently applied. If not, it may be necessary to introduce additional controls or improve compliance with existing ones.

**Common misunderstanding: If thereâ€™s no accident, current controls are sufficient.**

Even if no accidents have occurred, it doesn't automatically mean that existing controls are effective. Regularly review and test these controls to ensure they are still protecting your staff.

**Common misunderstanding: More controls mean better safety.**

Adding more controls isn't always the best solution. It's more important to have the right controls that are properly implemented and adhered to. Over-complicating safety measures can sometimes lead to confusion and non-compliance.
