Batch-cooked foods must be used within three days, and that includes the day you made it. For example, if you prepare something on Tuesday, it needs to be used by the end of Thursday's last shift.

Make sure to label all batch-cooked items clearly with the preparation date to maintain proper rotation.

**Common misunderstanding: Batch-cooked food can be safely consumed as long as it smells and looks fine, regardless of the three-day guideline.**

While sensory checks can be helpful, relying solely on smell and appearance is not a safe practice. Bacteria can grow to harmful levels even if food looks and smells normal. Adhering to the three-day guideline is crucial to prevent food-borne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: You can extend the fridge storage life of batch-cooked food by reheating it daily.**

Reheating batch-cooked food does not reset its storage clock. The three-day guideline accounts for bacterial growth that can occur even if the food is reheated. Continual reheating can degrade food quality and increase the risk of contamination.

## What about if we freeze the batch-cooked food instead?

While freezing can extend the life of your batch-cooked food, there are important rules to follow when you defrost it. Once you've fully defrosted any frozen food, you must use it within 24 hours.

**Common misunderstanding:: Freezing batch-cooked food kills all bacteria, making it completely safe indefinitely.**

Freezing does not kill bacteria; it merely halts their growth. Once defrosted, bacteria can become active again, so it is crucial to consume the food within 24 hours after defrosting to minimize risk of food-borne illness.

**Common misunderstanding:: You can refreeze batch-cooked food multiple times after defrosting without any issues.**

Refreezing food after defrosting can significantly degrade its quality and increase the risk of bacterial contamination. It's important to plan portions appropriately and avoid refreezing to ensure safety and maintain food quality.

## Do we need to cover batch-cooked food in the fridge?

Yes, all stored food must be properly covered to prevent physical, allergenic and microbiological contamination. Only use food-grade storage containers or food-grade wrapping materials - never use tea towels or regular cloths to cover food as this is not acceptable.
