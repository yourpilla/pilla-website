When writing a job description for a Barista, it's important to clearly state the level of experience required. This helps to attract candidates who are a good fit for the role. Specify whether you need an entry-level, mid-level, or senior Barista, and describe the kind of environment or equipment they should have experience with.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience always means years worked.**

Experience isn't just about the number of years someone has worked. It's more about what they've done during that time. For example, six months in a busy specialty coffee shop might be more relevant than two years at a slow-paced café with limited coffee offerings.

**Common misunderstanding: All experience is the same.**

Not all barista jobs are alike. Specify the type of experience that matters most for your café, such as working with high-volume sales, specialty coffee, or manual espresso machines. This ensures you get applicants who are prepared for your specific environment.

## Should we list time-based experience or situational familiarity in job descriptions?

It's best to combine both time-based experience and situational familiarity in your job descriptions. While it's useful to know how long someone has worked as a Barista, it's equally important to understand the settings they've worked in. Describe the type of café, the pace, and the equipment they should be familiar with.

**Common misunderstanding: Time-based experience is enough to gauge skill level.**

Just knowing how long someone has been a Barista doesn't tell you if they can handle the specific demands of your café. It's crucial to know if they've thrived in similar environments to yours.

**Common misunderstanding: Situational familiarity can be vague.**

Be specific when describing the situational experience. Instead of saying "experience in a busy café," specify what 'busy' means for your café, such as the number of covers per day or the style of service (e.g., high-volume takeaway orders).

## How do I prevent excluding good candidates by demanding too much experience?

To avoid excluding potentially good candidates, be realistic and flexible about the experience requirements. Clearly differentiate between 'must-have' and 'nice-to-have' skills and experience. This allows candidates who may lack certain specifics but are capable and willing to learn quickly to still apply.

**Common misunderstanding: More experience always equals better performance.**

While experience is valuable, a candidate's ability to learn, adapt, and fit into your team culture can be just as important. Sometimes, less experienced candidates bring fresh perspectives and a strong willingness to learn.

**Common misunderstanding: Setting high experience requirements will ensure only the best candidates apply.**

Setting the bar too high can deter talented individuals who might excel in the role but don't precisely meet the stringent criteria. It's better to focus on core competencies and the ability to perform well in your specific environment.
