# What is a food safety policy statement?

A food safety policy statement is a written commitment by a hospitality business to maintain safe food handling, preparation, and storage practices. It outlines the responsibilities of both management and staff to ensure the health and safety of food served to customers. This statement is crucial for setting standards and procedures that comply with legal requirements and protect public health.

**Common misunderstanding: A food safety policy statement is just a formality and doesn’t need to be taken seriously.**

It's not just a piece of paper; it's a critical document that guides the entire team on how to handle food safely. Ignoring it can lead to serious health risks for customers and legal consequences for the business.

**Common misunderstanding: Once written, the food safety policy statement doesn’t need to be updated.**

Food safety guidelines and regulations can change. It’s important to review and update the policy regularly to ensure compliance and reflect any new practices or changes in the business.

## Why is a food safety policy important for hospitality businesses?

Having a clear food safety policy is essential for any hospitality business. It ensures that all staff members are aware of their roles in maintaining food safety, reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses, and demonstrates a commitment to customer health. This policy also helps in training new staff and serves as a reference for maintaining consistent safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: A food safety policy is only necessary for large restaurants or hotels.**

Every business that handles food, no matter the size, needs a food safety policy. This includes small cafes, food trucks, and even pop-up restaurants. It’s crucial for ensuring safe food handling across the board.

**Common misunderstanding: Having a food safety policy means you don’t need regular staff training.**

A written policy is a starting point, but regular training and updates are necessary to reinforce practices and introduce any new regulations or changes in procedures. Continuous education helps keep everyone informed and compliant.

## Who should write and who should read a food safety policy?

The food safety policy should be written by someone with a deep understanding of food safety regulations and best practices, typically a qualified safety officer or consultant. However, it’s important that all levels of staff, from management to kitchen and service personnel, read and understand the policy. This ensures everyone is on the same page regarding safety practices and responsibilities.

**Common misunderstanding: Only kitchen staff need to worry about the food safety policy.**

While kitchen staff play a major role, food safety is everyone’s responsibility in a hospitality business. Front-of-house staff, cleaners, and anyone who might handle food or food contact surfaces must also understand and follow the policy.

**Common misunderstanding: The food safety policy is too complex for everyone to understand.**

The policy should be written clearly and concisely so that all employees can understand it, regardless of their role or experience level. It’s also helpful to include practical examples and regular training sessions to clarify any complex parts.
