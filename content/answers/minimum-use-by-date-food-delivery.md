When accepting food deliveries, you should ensure that products with use-by dates have a minimum of 5 days usage remaining. This gives you enough time to safely use the products before they expire while maintaining food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the food looks and smells okay, the use-by date isn't important.**

This is a misconception. Use-by dates are established for safety reasons, particularly with perishable items like dairy and meats, which can harbor harmful bacteria even if they appear fine. It is crucial to adhere to these dates to avoid potential health risks.

## What about best before dates - is it the same?

No, best before dates have different requirements. For products with best before dates, you should ensure they have a minimum of 1 month remaining when accepting deliveries. This longer timeframe reflects the different nature of best before versus use-by dates.

**Common misunderstanding: Best before dates are equivalent to use-by dates and indicate food safety.**

Best before dates are about the quality and freshness of the product, not safety. Food past its best before date may not be at peak quality but can still be safe to consume. It's important to distinguish this from use-by dates, which are strictly for food safety.

## What should I do if a delivery arrives with shorter dates than these minimums?

If products arrive with shorter dates than the minimum requirements (less than 5 days for use-by or less than 1 month for best before), you should reject those items and contact your supplier. Make sure to clearly label any rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them separately until they can be returned to the supplier. This helps maintain your food safety standards and ensures you're not accepting products that might expire too quickly.

**Common misunderstanding: You can always negotiate with suppliers to accept deliveries with shorter dates if you plan to use them quickly.**

While it might seem beneficial to accept products with shorter dates to avoid delays, compromising on these standards can risk food safety and regulatory compliance. It's advisable to adhere strictly to the minimum date requirements to ensure quality and safety.
