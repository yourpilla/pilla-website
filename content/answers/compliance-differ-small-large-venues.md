Under Martyn's Law, the compliance requirements for hospitality venues vary based on their size. Small venues (with a capacity of 200-799 people) have less stringent requirements compared to large venues (800+ people). Small venues focus on basic, cost-effective security measures and emergency procedures, while large venues must implement more comprehensive security measures and document their security plans in detail.

**Common misunderstanding: Small venues need to install expensive security equipment.**

Actually, small venues are not required by law to install costly security infrastructure. The focus is on procedural readiness, such as developing emergency plans and training staff, rather than on physical security enhancements.

**Common misunderstanding: Large venues just need to increase staff training.**

While staff training is crucial, large venues also need to undertake significant security measures, such as risk assessments, enhanced surveillance, and possibly physical barriers or advanced screening processes, depending on the outcome of their risk assessments.

## What does Martyn’s Law compliance look like for a small restaurant?

A small restaurant, under Martyn's Law, falls into the standard tier if it accommodates between 200 and 799 people. Compliance primarily involves registering the venue with the Security Industry Authority (SIA), creating a terrorism response plan, and ensuring staff are trained on this plan. The focus is on practical, manageable steps to enhance preparedness without significant financial burden.

**Common misunderstanding: Every small restaurant must comply with Martyn's Law.**

Only those small restaurants expecting 200 or more people at one time need to comply. If your restaurant typically hosts fewer than 200 people, it's exempt from these regulations but can still adopt safety measures voluntarily.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance for small restaurants is complicated and technical.**

In fact, compliance is designed to be straightforward, requiring basic emergency planning and staff training, which integrates with existing safety procedures like fire drills.

## What does Martyn’s Law compliance look like for a large nightclub or event venue?

For large venues like nightclubs or event venues that can host 800 or more people, Martyn's Law mandates a more rigorous set of security measures. These venues must not only register and train staff but also conduct detailed risk assessments, implement robust security measures (e.g., CCTV, controlled entry points, bag checks), and maintain a comprehensive written security plan. This plan must be submitted to the SIA, detailing how the venue addresses potential terrorist threats.

**Common misunderstanding: Large venues just need more cameras and security guards.**

While increased surveillance and security personnel are important, the law requires a holistic approach to security, including risk assessments and emergency procedures tailored to specific threats and vulnerabilities.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the security plan is submitted, no further action is required.**

Actually, large venues must regularly update their security plans and training to reflect new threats, changes in layout, or operational practices, ensuring ongoing compliance and effectiveness.
