# What does your food safety policy need to say about HACCP?

Your food safety policy should clearly outline your commitment to the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system. This means stating how you will identify, evaluate, and control hazards that could impact food safety. The policy should detail the processes for monitoring critical control points, corrective actions to be taken when necessary, and the responsibilities of team members in maintaining HACCP standards.

**Common misunderstanding: HACCP is just another guideline, not a requirement.**

HACCP is not just a recommendation; it's a systematic approach that is essential for managing food safety risks. In many jurisdictions, implementing HACCP is a legal requirement for businesses handling food.

**Common misunderstanding: A general statement about food safety is sufficient for compliance.**

A general statement is not enough. Your policy needs to specifically address how HACCP principles are applied in your operations to ensure compliance and effective food safety management.

## How do you show commitment to HACCP in your policy statement?

To show commitment to HACCP in your policy statement, explicitly state that your business adheres to HACCP principles. Include a commitment to ongoing training for staff on HACCP procedures and regular reviews of your HACCP plan to adapt to any changes in operations or legislation. Highlight the allocation of resources to ensure that HACCP is properly implemented and maintained across all areas of your business.

**Common misunderstanding: Mentioning HACCP once is enough to show commitment.**

Simply mentioning HACCP does not demonstrate commitment. Detailed descriptions of how HACCP is integrated into daily operations and decision-making processes are crucial.

**Common misunderstanding: Commitment to HACCP does not need to be part of the formal policy.**

Integrating HACCP commitment into your formal policy is essential as it not only ensures compliance but also communicates the importance of food safety to your team and stakeholders.

## What are critical control points and why should they be mentioned in a policy?

Critical control points (CCPs) are stages in the food production process where hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels. Mentioning CCPs in your policy is important because it highlights your business’s proactive approach to identifying and managing risks at specific points in the production process. This inclusion underlines the seriousness with which you treat food safety and the specific actions your team must take to uphold it.

**Common misunderstanding: All steps in the food handling process are considered critical control points.**

Not all steps in the process are CCPs. Only those that can be used to control a hazard likely to cause a food safety problem are designated as CCPs. It’s important to identify these accurately in your HACCP plan.

**Common misunderstanding: Once CCPs are set, they do not need to be reviewed.**

CCPs should be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect changes in the production process, technology, or compliance requirements. This ensures the ongoing effectiveness of your food safety management system.
