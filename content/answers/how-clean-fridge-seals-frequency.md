# How often should we clean the fridge seals?

The fridge seals, along with condensers and vents, should be inspected weekly to check both their condition and cleanliness. This regular maintenance is essential for keeping the unit working efficiently.

A dirty or faulty seal can let warm air in, which affects the temperature inside the fridge and could lead to bacterial growth and food spoilage.What happens if we find the seal is damaged during the weekly check?

If you find the seal is damaged or not creating a proper seal, it needs to be replaced immediately. A faulty seal will allow warm air to enter the fridge, causing temperature fluctuations that could compromise food safety. Until the seal is replaced, you'll need to monitor the fridge temperature more frequently to ensure it's maintaining the correct temperature.

**Common misunderstanding:: Fridge seals do not need to be cleaned if the rest of the fridge is regularly sanitised.**

While sanitising the interior of your fridge is crucial, fridge seals require special attention because they can harbour bacteria and mould if neglected. Cleaning and inspecting seals weekly helps ensure they are free from debris that might compromise their effectiveness, which is essential for maintaining consistent temperatures and preventing food spoilage.

**Common misunderstanding: Only professional technicians can properly inspect fridge seals for damage.**

While professional technicians are trained to handle various appliance issues, inspecting fridge seals is a task that can be effectively performed by in-house staff. Regular visual inspections and simple tests, such as the dollar bill test, can identify weak seals. If you can easily pull a bill out from a closed door seal, it indicates a potential leak, and timely action can prevent more significant issues.
