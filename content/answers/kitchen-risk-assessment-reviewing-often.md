---
It's essential to review your kitchen risk assessment at least once every 12 months. This regular check helps ensure that any changes in operations or the environment that could impact safety are accounted for. If you use a system like Pilla, it can remind you automatically, making it easier to stay on top of this important task.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a risk assessment is done, it doesnâ€™t need to be reviewed unless there is a problem.**

Even if no incidents occur, it's important to review your risk assessment regularly. This ensures it remains relevant and effective as your kitchen operations evolve. Every 12 months is appropriate.

**Common misunderstanding: A risk assessment only needs to be reviewed if the law changes.**

While legal changes are important, other factors such as new equipment, staff changes, or operational shifts also necessitate reviews to maintain safety standards.

## What changes should trigger an early kitchen risk assessment review?

If significant changes occur in your kitchen, don't wait for the annual review; update your risk assessment as soon as possible. Significant changes include introducing new equipment, altering the layout, hiring new staff, experiencing an accident or near miss, or facing major maintenance issues. These changes can introduce new hazards or alter how existing risks are managed.

**Common misunderstanding: Only new equipment needs to be considered for an early review.**

While new equipment is a common trigger, other changes like alterations in kitchen layout or staffing also significantly impact safety and should prompt a review.

**Common misunderstanding: Equipment repairs don't necessitate a risk assessment review.**

Even repairs can affect operational safety, especially if they involve critical equipment or safety features, so they should be considered when deciding whether to conduct an early review.

## What is the best way to remember to review kitchen risk assessments?

Setting a recurring reminder is the most effective way to ensure that your kitchen risk assessment is reviewed regularly. If you're using a management system like Pilla, you can set up automatic reminders. Alternatively, you can use digital calendars like Google Calendar to set annual reminders, or maintain a manual log in a planner dedicated to compliance tasks.

**Common misunderstanding: Keeping mental notes is sufficient for remembering to do reviews.**

Relying on memory for such critical tasks can lead to oversights. Always use a reliable reminder system.

**Common misunderstanding: Reminders are only necessary for large kitchens or restaurants.**

All kitchens, regardless of size, benefit from systematic reminders to ensure safety practices are up to date and effective.
