When using a probe thermometer, you need to wait until the temperature reading remains static for at least 10 seconds before taking your reading. This ensures you get an accurate measurement.

Remember to keep the probe at least 2 inches deep in whatever you're testing, and make sure it's not touching the sides or bottom of any container.

**Common misunderstanding: You can rely on the colour or texture of food to determine doneness instead of using a thermometer.**

Relying on color or texture alone is not a reliable method for determining if food is cooked to a safe internal temperature. Use of a food probe thermometer is the only accurate way to ensure food safety and doneness, as visual cues can be misleading and vary by food type.

**Common misunderstanding: Thermometers only need to be calibrated once.**

Thermometers should be calibrated regularly to ensure accuracy. Environmental factors, frequent use, and wear and tear can cause them to drift over time. Regular calibration according to the manufacturer's instructions is essential for reliable readings.

## What if the reading keeps fluctuating and won't stabilise?

If your probe reading won't stabilise, this could indicate an issue with your thermometer. First, check that you've cleaned and sanitised it properly. If the problem persists, inspect the probe for any damage like cracks or bends that might affect its accuracy. You may need to take it out of service and use a replacement probe if these issues are present.

**Common misunderstanding: If the thermometer reading fluctuates, the food is not at a uniform temperature.**

Fluctuating readings can often result from improper thermometer use rather than uneven food temperature. Ensure the probe is inserted correctly and not touching bone, fat, or sides of the container. Also, inspect the thermometer for damage or calibration issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning the probe with water alone is sufficient for maintaining accuracy and hygiene.**

Simply rinsing the probe with water is not enough to ensure hygiene and accuracy. Proper sanitisation with an appropriate solution is necessary to prevent cross-contamination and maintain the accuracy of temperature readings.

## Do I need to wait the same amount of time when testing both hot and cold temperatures?

Yes, whether you're testing in boiling water or an ice bath, you should always wait for that 10-second period of stable temperature before recording your reading. This applies to both hot testing at 100°C and cold testing at 0°C. Just remember that when testing cold temperatures in an ice bath, you should avoid touching ice cubes directly with the probe as this can give false readings.

**Common misunderstanding: You only need to test hot foods with a thermometer; cold foods don't require the same attention.**

Both hot and cold foods require accurate temperature readings to ensure safety. Cold foods must be kept at safe temperatures to prevent bacterial growth, just as hot foods must reach certain temperatures to ensure pathogens are killed.

**Common misunderstanding: Thermometer probes can be used interchangeably between different types of foods without cleaning.**

Using the same thermometer probe on different foods without proper cleaning can lead to cross-contamination, particularly between raw and cooked foods. Always clean and sanitize the probe between uses to maintain food safety.
