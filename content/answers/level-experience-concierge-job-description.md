# What level of experience should be specified in a Concierge job description?

When writing a job description for a Concierge, it's important to clearly state the level of experience required. Decide if the role is entry-level, mid-level, or senior, and specify the type and level of experience needed. This helps set clear expectations and attracts suitable candidates.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience always means years worked.**

It's not just about how long someone has worked, but also about the relevance of their experience. For example, experience in a high-traffic luxury hotel is different from a quiet boutique hotel. Be specific about the type of experience that fits your needs.

**Common misunderstanding: High experience requirements guarantee better candidates.**

Setting experience requirements too high can deter capable candidates who might excel with some training. Consider what is essential for the role and what can be taught on the job.

## When should I consider candidates without direct hospitality experience?

Consider candidates without direct hospitality experience for entry-level positions where you are willing to provide training. Look for transferable skills such as customer service, communication, and problem-solving abilities. These candidates can bring fresh perspectives and adapt quickly.

**Common misunderstanding: Candidates without hospitality experience are not suitable for Concierge roles.**

Many skills from other customer-focused industries are transferable to hospitality roles. Candidates with such backgrounds can succeed in Concierge positions, especially if they show a strong desire to learn and adapt.

**Common misunderstanding: Training new staff is too time-consuming and costly.**

While training requires time and resources, investing in enthusiastic candidates without direct experience can lead to loyal, highly capable staff. They often bring new ideas and a fresh approach to guest service.

## How do I communicate experience requirements for both entry-level and senior positions?

Clearly differentiate the experience requirements in your job description. For entry-level positions, indicate that no prior experience is necessary but a passion for service is crucial. For senior roles, specify the need for proven experience in similar environments and the ability to handle complex guest interactions.

**Common misunderstanding: Entry-level means the candidate can be inexperienced in all areas.**

Even for entry-level roles, highlight the importance of certain core skills or traits, such as communication or enthusiasm for hospitality, to ensure candidates understand the expectations.

**Common misunderstanding: Senior positions only need industry experience.**

Senior roles often require not just experience but specific skills such as leadership, strategic thinking, and advanced problem-solving. Make sure to communicate these requirements to attract the right candidates.
