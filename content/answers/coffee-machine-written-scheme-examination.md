# Does my coffee machine need a Written Scheme of Examination (WSE)?

If your coffee machine uses steam under pressure, such as most commercial espresso machines, it likely requires a Written Scheme of Examination (WSE). This is a legal requirement under the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR) to ensure the machine is safe to operate.

**Common misunderstanding: My machine is small, so it doesn't need a WSE.**

Size doesn't exempt you from needing a WSE. If the machine operates above 0.5 bar pressure, it requires a WSE, regardless of its physical size or capacity.

**Common misunderstanding: Servicing is enough, so a WSE isn't necessary.**

Regular servicing maintains machine performance but does not replace the safety checks required in a WSE, which are specifically designed to assess pressure system integrity and safety.

## What is the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR) and how does it affect coffee machines?

The Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR) are UK regulations designed to prevent accidents from the failure of pressure systems. They require that systems like espresso machines, which use steam or pressurised water, are regularly inspected and have a current WSE.

**Common misunderstanding: PSSR only applies to large industrial equipment.**

PSSR applies to any pressure system that could pose a risk, including smaller systems like coffee machines in cafes and restaurants.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance with PSSR is optional.**

Compliance with PSSR is mandatory if your equipment falls under its scope. Non-compliance can lead to legal consequences and safety hazards.

## Who can carry out a pressure system inspection for my coffee machine?

A pressure system inspection must be conducted by a competent person. This is typically an engineer with the qualifications and experience to assess the safety of pressure systems. They should be independent of the routine maintenance services to ensure an unbiased examination.

**Common misunderstanding: Any engineer can perform the inspection.**

Not all engineers are qualified to conduct WSEs. The engineer must have specific training and credentials in pressure system safety.

**Common misunderstanding: In-house staff can carry out the inspection if they know the machine well.**

Even if your in-house team is familiar with the machine, the law requires an independent and qualified competent person to perform the WSE to ensure compliance and safety.
