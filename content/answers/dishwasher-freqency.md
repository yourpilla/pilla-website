Dishwasher temperatures need to be checked and recorded twice daily, typically once in the morning and once in the afternoon. This ensures that the dishwasher operates at the correct temperatures required for sanitising dishes effectively, which are 55-60°C for the wash cycle and 82-88°C for the final rinse.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the temperature once a day is sufficient.**

Checking only once a day can miss fluctuations that might happen due to changes in use or mechanical issues. Twice daily checks provide a more accurate and reliable record of the dishwasher's performance throughout the day.

**Common misunderstanding: Temperature checks can be skipped on slow days.**

Even on slow days, it's important to maintain regular checks to ensure compliance and readiness for any sudden increase in use. Consistent checks prevent potential health risks regardless of how busy the kitchen is.

**Common misunderstanding: Manual records are just as good as digital records.**

While manual records can be used, digital records like Pilla provide a secure, timestamped, and easily accessible log which is crucial for compliance and inspections. Digital records also reduce the risk of human error in data entry and record keeping.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to record temperatures anytime during the day.**

Temperatures should be recorded at consistent times each day, typically once in the morning and once in the afternoon, to ensure that the dishwasher maintains the required temperatures during its peak operational hours.

## What should I do if I miss a scheduled temperature check?

If you miss a scheduled temperature check, perform the check as soon as you remember. If the temperature is not within the required range, follow the corrective actions as outlined in the Pilla system and record these actions. Consistency is key, so try to return to the regular schedule as quickly as possible.

**Common misunderstanding: Missing one temperature check is not a big deal.**

Missing any temperature check can lead to non-compliance with food safety regulations and increase the risk of health hazards. Every check is important for ensuring the effectiveness of the sanitation process.

**Common misunderstanding: If a check is missed, it can be skipped until the next scheduled time.**

Skipping the missed check entirely will leave gaps in the temperature records, potentially missing critical fluctuations and won't look impressive during official inspections. Always perform the check as soon as possible after it's missed and maintain accurate records.
