# How quickly do I need to put food deliveries away?

Food deliveries should be transferred from the delivery point to storage areas within 15 minutes, including the time needed for unboxing. In exceptional circumstances, you can take up to 30 minutes maximum, but this should not be the norm.

When putting deliveries away, you need to prioritize in this order: chilled foods first, then frozen goods, and finally ambient/dry goods. This is crucial for maintaining the cold chain and food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the food is transferred within 30 minutes, the exact order of storage is not critical.**

Prioritising the order of storage is crucial because different types of food are susceptible to temperature changes at different rates. Chilled foods are most vulnerable to temperature variations and should be stored first to maintain safety and quality. Ignoring this order can compromise food safety and lead to spoilage.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a delivery is inside the building, it is safe from any temperature-related risks.**

Simply bringing food deliveries inside does not eliminate temperature risks. The internal temperature can quickly rise if perishables are not stored correctly and promptly. It's essential to complete the entire storage process, including unboxing and prioritising chilled items, within the recommended time frame to ensure food safety.

## What happens if I can't put everything away within 15 minutes?

While 30 minutes is the absolute maximum time allowed in exceptional circumstances, you should look at why you're unable to meet the 15-minute target. You might need to rearrange delivery times or add additional staff during delivery periods. The most important thing is ensuring chilled goods are stored quickly as they're most vulnerable to temperature changes.

**Common misunderstanding: If I can't meet the 15-minute goal, it's acceptable to leave deliveries in a cool area until I can get to them.**

Leaving deliveries in a cool area is not a substitute for proper storage. Ambient temperatures, even in seemingly cool areas, can fluctuate and affect the integrity of perishable goods. It's vital to address the underlying issues that prevent timely storage, such as staffing or scheduling adjustments, to maintain food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Extending the storage time beyond 15 minutes is generally okay if it’s only occasional.**

While occasional deviations may not immediately lead to food safety issues, consistently stretching the time frame increases the risk of temperature abuse, affecting both quality and safety. Regularly exceeding recommended limits necessitates operational changes to prevent potential food safety hazards.

## Do I need to unbox everything before putting it in storage?

Yes, you should unbox items before storage, but this needs to be done in a separate designated area to avoid contamination. This unboxing time is included in your 15-minute window, so make sure you have enough staff and space to handle deliveries efficiently. Remember that maintaining the cold chain (keeping chilled goods below 5°C) is critical during this process.

**Common misunderstanding: Unboxing can wait until after the items are in storage as long as the boxes are clean.**

Unboxing should occur before storage to ensure that any potential contaminants on the packaging are not introduced into storage areas. Even if packaging appears clean, it can harbour bacteria or other contaminants that might compromise food safety if not handled properly.

**Common misunderstanding: You can skip unboxing if the delivery volume is too high and time is short.**

Skipping the unboxing step can lead to cross-contamination and disrupt the cold chain, especially if boxes are not designed for long-term storage. Efficient unboxing within a designated area is vital to maintain food integrity and safety, regardless of delivery volume.
