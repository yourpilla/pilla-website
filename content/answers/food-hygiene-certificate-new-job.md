  Your current food hygiene certificate is valid if it is the appropriate level
  for your role and has not expired.
---
Your existing food hygiene certificate is valid as long as it's the correct level for your role and hasn't expired. Food hygiene certificates need to be renewed every 3 years for Level 1 and Level 2. If you're moving into a supervisory role, you'll need Level 3, even if your Level 2 is still valid.

The key is ensuring your certificate matches your current responsibilities. For example, if you're handling high-risk foods, you need at least Level 2, regardless of any Level 1 certificates you might have.

**Common misunderstanding: Once you have a food hygiene certificate, you never need to update it as long as you stay in the same role.**

This is a misconception. Even if you remain in the same role, food hygiene certificates need to be renewed every three years to ensure you are up-to-date with current food safety standards and practices. Regulations can change, and continuous education helps in maintaining compliance and safety.

## What if I can't get my current training certificate from my previous job?

In that case, you can't prove your understanding of food hygiene and you should take another course. Even if you've taken one in the last three years, without a certificate, you and and the business you now work for aren't protected. You may have the required knowledge but there's no way to prove it.

**Common misunderstanding: Verbal confirmation from a previous employer is sufficient proof of training if a certificate is unavailable.**

Verbal confirmation is not an acceptable substitute for a formal certificate. Employers and regulatory bodies require tangible proof of training to ensure compliance with food safety regulations. Without a certificate, there is no verifiable evidence of your training, potentially exposing both yourself and your employer to liability.

**Common misunderstanding: If you can't retrieve your training certificate, you can simply start working and get the certification later.**

This approach can be risky. Working without a valid training certificate may violate regulatory requirements and expose your employer to potential fines or legal issues. It's crucial to have the necessary certifications in place before beginning any role that involves food handling to ensure compliance and safety.
