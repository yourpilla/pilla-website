---
Front of house checklists should be reviewed at least once a month, or whenever there's a major change like a new menu, a change in staff roles, or updates in equipment. Regular reviews keep the checklists relevant and ensure they continue to meet the needs of your team and your service standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a checklist is created, it doesn’t need to be changed unless there is a problem.**

Even if no issues are apparent, regular reviews can uncover opportunities for improvement and adapt to subtle shifts in operations or customer expectations. It’s about proactive management, not just reactive fixes.

**Common misunderstanding: Checklists only need reviewing annually.**

Annual reviews might miss changes that affect daily operations. Frequent reviews help catch small issues before they become big problems and keep the checklist effective all year round.

## What kind of feedback should be gathered from staff about checklists?

Feedback from staff should focus on clarity, relevance, and practicality of the checklist tasks. Ask your team if there are any tasks that feel unnecessary, unclear, or consistently missed. Encourage them to suggest improvements and share whether the checklists help them in their daily roles or create unnecessary hurdles.

**Common misunderstanding: Staff feedback on checklists is only about what’s wrong.**

Positive feedback is just as valuable. Knowing which parts of the checklist work well can help you understand what to maintain during revisions.

**Common misunderstanding: Only negative incidents should trigger feedback requests.**

Regular feedback should be encouraged, not just feedback following issues. This continuous input can drive consistent improvements and staff engagement.

## How do checklists stay aligned with standard operating procedures (SOPs)?

Checklists should be directly aligned with your venue's SOPs by using consistent language and steps as described in training and operational guides. If SOPs change, the checklists should be updated simultaneously to avoid confusion and ensure compliance. Regular training sessions can help reinforce this alignment.

**Common misunderstanding: Checklists and SOPs are separate tools.**

They should function together. A checklist is a practical application of SOPs, guiding daily actions based on broader operational policies.
