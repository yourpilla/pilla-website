# Why is it important to reheat food to the correct temperature?

Reheating food to the correct temperature is crucial to ensure that harmful bacteria are killed. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the required minimum temperature is 75°C, while in Scotland, it's 82°C. This process reduces bacteria to safe levels, making the food safe to eat.

**Common misunderstanding: All food needs to be reheated to the same temperature regardless of location.**

Temperature requirements can vary by region. Always check local food hygiene laws to ensure compliance and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheating food just needs to make it hot enough to eat.**

It's not just about the food being hot to the touch; it must reach a temperature that is high enough to reduce bacterial presence to safe levels.

## What can happen if food isn't reheated properly?

If food is not reheated properly, bacteria and spores can survive and even multiply, leading to food-borne illnesses. Improper reheating can allow bacteria to produce toxins, which are not always destroyed by further cooking. This can pose serious health risks.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to reheat food slowly on low heat.**

Slow reheating can allow bacteria to multiply. Always reheat food quickly to the required temperature to prevent this risk.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheating food more than once is safe if it reaches the correct temperature each time.**

Food should never be reheated more than once. Multiple reheating can increase the risk of food poisoning.

## Why must internal temperatures of reheated food be checked before serving?

Checking the internal temperature of reheated food ensures it has reached a safe temperature throughout. This is crucial for killing any bacteria present. Use a food thermometer to check that every part of the food has reached the required minimum temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the temperature of food in just one place is enough.**

It’s important to check the temperature in several places, especially in thicker dishes, to ensure the entire portion has been adequately reheated.

**Common misunderstanding: If the surface is hot, the whole food item is safe to eat.**

The surface of the food can feel hot while the internal parts may not have reached the necessary temperature. Always check internally.
