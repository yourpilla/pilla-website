# What specific tasks should be completed at the bar or service station before opening?

Before your bar or service station opens, there are several important tasks to ensure everything runs smoothly. Start by wiping and sanitising the bar tops and drip trays. Make sure the ice well is clean and filled with fresh ice. Check that all garnishes are stocked and stored properly, and that the fridges are organised and clean. It's also crucial to ensure the glasswasher is clean, empty, and ready for use, and that all EPOS/till systems are logged in and functioning.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick visual check of the bar area is sufficient for opening.**

Simply looking over the bar isn't enough. You need to physically check and clean each component to ensure no issues arise during service, such as dirty equipment or unstocked items that could delay service.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s not necessary to check the functionality of electronic systems daily.**

Daily checks of EPOS/till systems and other electronic devices are essential. Technical issues can lead to significant delays in service, affecting customer satisfaction. Always verify that everything is working correctly before service begins.

## How can poor bar prep affect speed of service?

Poor preparation at the bar can significantly slow down service. If garnishes, ice, or glassware aren't ready, or if the bar area is cluttered and unorganised, bartenders spend more time preparing these elements during service, which increases wait times for customers. This not only impacts customer satisfaction but can also reduce the number of drinks served, affecting revenue.

**Common misunderstanding: Bar preparation only affects the bar area and staff.**

Poor bar prep impacts the entire service, not just the bartenders. Delays at the bar can lead to longer wait times for table service and decrease overall efficiency in the restaurant.

**Common misunderstanding: Restocking during quieter periods can compensate for inadequate opening prep.**

Trying to restock during service can cause further delays and errors. It’s much more efficient to have everything prepared in advance to ensure a smooth operation throughout the service period.

## What risks are associated with an unclean or unprepared bar area?

An unclean or unprepared bar poses several risks. Firstly, it can lead to hygiene issues, attracting pests like fruit flies and potentially causing food safety problems. Secondly, an unprepared bar can slow down service, leading to customer dissatisfaction and decreased sales. Lastly, it can create a negative impression of your establishment, affecting your reputation and customer return rates.

**Common misunderstanding: A slightly messy bar won’t affect customer perceptions.**

Customers often equate the cleanliness of visible areas like the bar with the overall hygiene standards of the establishment. A messy or dirty bar can lead customers to question the cleanliness of the entire venue.

**Common misunderstanding: The cleanliness of the bar area is only important during health inspections.**

While health inspections are important, maintaining a clean bar is crucial at all times for safety, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Regular cleaning and preparation are key to avoiding potential health risks and ensuring a positive customer experience.
