If your blast chiller stops working, you need to switch to alternative cooling methods quickly to keep food safe. Use methods like spreading food out to increase surface area, stirring liquids, or using ice water baths to cool food rapidly. Remember, food must reach a safe temperature within 90 minutes to prevent bacteria growth.

**Common misunderstanding: If the blast chiller breaks down, it's safe to wait for it to be fixed before cooling food.**

Waiting for a blast chiller repair can put food at risk. Always have a backup plan to cool food quickly without the chiller. This ensures you maintain food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooling food in any fridge or freezer is fine if the blast chiller breaks down.**

Standard fridges and freezers aren't designed for rapid cooling of hot food and can raise the internal temperature, putting all stored food at risk. Use appropriate rapid cooling techniques instead.

## How do I safely cool hot food without a blast chiller?

To cool hot food safely without a blast chiller, spread the food out in shallow trays to increase surface area or divide it into smaller portions. Use ice water baths or run cold potable water over foods like pasta and vegetables. Always ensure that the food reaches a safe temperature within 90 minutes.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooling food at room temperature is an effective method.**

Leaving hot food to cool at room temperature can allow bacteria to grow. Always use active cooling methods to reduce the temperature quickly and safely.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to put hot food directly into the refrigerator.**

Placing hot food in a refrigerator can raise the internal temperature and put other stored food at risk. Use methods like ice water baths to initially reduce the temperature before refrigerating.

## What are the risks if I don't cool hot food quickly without a blast chiller?

Not cooling hot food quickly can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria, as temperatures between 20-50°C are ideal for bacteria to multiply. This can result in foodborne illnesses. Ensure rapid cooling to maintain food safety and prevent potential health risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooling food slowly is safer as it prevents thermal shock.**

While thermal shock can be a concern for some foods, the risk of bacterial growth in slowly cooled food is far greater. It's crucial to cool food quickly to prevent bacteria from reaching dangerous levels.

**Common misunderstanding: If food looks and smells fine, it's safe to eat regardless of cooling time.**

Food can look and smell normal even when it's unsafe. Bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli can grow without changing the appearance or smell of food. Always adhere to safe cooling practices.
