# What happens if I drop my food probe thermometer?

If you drop your probe thermometer, you should immediately stop using it and inspect it carefully. Even minor impacts can damage the sensitive equipment inside, which could lead to unreliable temperature readings. Look for any visible damage like cracks, chips, or a bent probe tip.

If you notice any damage, the probe should be taken out of service immediately and replaced. You'll need to get a new one or have it repaired by the manufacturer to ensure accurate readings.

**Common misunderstanding: A food probe thermometer will still work fine after being dropped as long as there is no visible damage.**

While there may be no visible damage, the internal components of a food probe thermometer can still be affected by the shock of being dropped. This can result in inaccurate temperature readings. It's essential to test the thermometer's accuracy after any drop, regardless of visible condition, to ensure it functions correctly.

## How can I tell if my dropped probe is still working correctly?

You can test the accuracy of your probe by performing both hot and cold calibration tests. Use boiling water (which should read 100째C) and an ice bath (which should read 0째C). If the readings are off by more than 1 degree in either direction, the probe needs to be replaced.

**Common misunderstanding: If the thermometer gives correct readings in normal conditions, it doesn't need regular recalibration.**

Even if a thermometer appears to give correct readings under normal conditions, regular recalibration is essential. Factors like temperature fluctuations, aging, and repeated use can affect its accuracy over time. Routine recalibration ensures sustained accuracy and reliability in temperature readings.

## Should I clean the probe after dropping it before testing?

Yes, before testing a dropped probe, you need to clean and sanitise it thoroughly. First wash it with warm soapy water, then rinse it clean, and finally sanitise it with alcohol swabs or an appropriate sanitising solution. This ensures any dirt from the drop doesn't affect the accuracy of your testing.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning the probe with just water is sufficient after it has been dropped.**

Simply rinsing the probe with water is not enough to ensure it is sanitised and free from contaminants after being dropped. Proper cleaning involves washing with warm soapy water, rinsing, and then sanitising with alcohol swabs or an appropriate sanitising solution to ensure all potential bacteria and dirt are removed, maintaining both hygiene and accuracy.
