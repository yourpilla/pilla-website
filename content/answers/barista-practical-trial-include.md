When you're looking to hire a new barista, a practical trial is a great way to see their skills in action. A typical trial should include tasks like pulling espresso shots, steaming and pouring milk, maintaining a clean and organised workstation, and handling a simple customer interaction. This setup gives you a clear view of their coffee-making skills, hygiene habits, and customer service approach.

**Common misunderstanding: A practical trial should test every possible skill.**

It's not necessary to test every skill in a practical trial. Focus on essential tasks that reflect the daily duties they will perform. Overloading the trial with too many tasks can be overwhelming and might not give you a true sense of their capabilities in key areas.

**Common misunderstanding: The more complex the drink preparation during the trial, the better.**

Complexity isn't always the best approach. Start with basic but essential tasks to assess their foundational skills. You can always train them on more complex recipes once they're hired, based on their basic skills and learning ability.

## How long should a Barista trial last?

A Barista trial should be long enough to assess their skills without being too draining. Typically, a 20 to 40-minute trial is sufficient. This time frame allows the candidate to demonstrate their coffee-making skills, cleanliness, and customer interaction without the pressure of a full shift.

**Common misunderstanding: A longer trial is always better as it shows more about the candidate.**

A longer trial isn't necessarily more revealing. A concise, well-structured trial respects the candidate's time and still provides enough insight into their capabilities and how they handle the pressure of a real service environment.

**Common misunderstanding: A trial should feel like a full work shift to test endurance.**

Testing endurance is less important in an initial trial. Focus on skill, efficiency, and attitude rather than stamina. The goal is to see how they perform key tasks, not how long they can last under stress.

## What are key tasks to observe in a Barista practical?

In a Barista practical trial, key tasks to observe include their ability to pull a consistent espresso shot, steam milk to the correct texture, maintain cleanliness and organisation of their station, and how they interact with customers. Observing these tasks gives you a comprehensive view of their technical skills and customer service approach.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the final product matters in a practical trial.**

While the quality of the coffee is important, how the barista achieves this result is equally crucial. Pay attention to their process, hygiene, and interaction, not just the taste of the coffee.

**Common misunderstanding: If a candidate is slow in their tasks, they're not right for the job.**

Speed is important, but consider the context. A candidate might be slower if they're being thorough or if it's their first time on your specific equipment. Assess their potential for speed with training and familiarity with the workspace.
