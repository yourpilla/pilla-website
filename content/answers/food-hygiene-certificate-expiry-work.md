# What happens if someone's food hygiene certificate expires - can they still work?

Food hygiene certificates must be renewed every 3 years for Level 1 and Level 2 staff. If a certificate expires, the staff member can continue handling food but you need to renew the training as soon as possible to prove the employee's understanding.

For Level 1 and 2 certificates, online renewal courses are available which can be completed quickly. However, it's best practice to schedule renewals before expiry to avoid any gaps in certification.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a food hygiene certificate expires, an employee must stop working immediately until they have renewed it.**

While it is crucial to renew food hygiene certificates promptly, employees can continue to work handling food even if their certificate has expired. However, employers should ensure the training is renewed as soon as possible to maintain compliance and demonstrate the employee's continued understanding of food safety practices.
