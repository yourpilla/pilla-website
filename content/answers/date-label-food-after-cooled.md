After cooling food, it's important to label it with the date it was cooked and cooled. This helps you keep track of how long the food can safely be stored before it must be used or thrown away. Always write the date on the container or use a date label so everyone in the kitchen can see it clearly.

**Common misunderstanding: Itâ€™s okay to just remember when food was cooled and use it within a few days.**

Relying on memory for food safety is risky. Always label your food. This avoids confusion and helps maintain food safety standards, ensuring no food past its safe use date is served.

**Common misunderstanding: You can label food just by the day it needs to be used.**

It's more effective to label food with the actual date it was cooled as well as the use-by date. This provides clear information on how long the food has been stored and helps manage inventory better.

## What is the maximum duration I can store cooled food?

Cooled food should be used within 3 days, including the day it was cooked and cooled. For example, if you cook and cool food on Wednesday, it should be used by Friday. After this period, the risk of bacterial growth increases, and the food should be discarded for safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooled food can be kept as long as it smells and looks fine.**

Food safety doesn't rely solely on smell or appearance. Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses might not affect the smell or look of food but can still be present. Always stick to the 3-day rule.

**Common misunderstanding: All types of cooled foods have the same storage duration.**

Different foods may have different storage guidelines based on their ingredients and how they were prepared. However, the general rule for many common kitchen-prepared foods is 3 days to ensure safety.

## Why must food be covered after cooling, and before refrigeration?

Covering food after it has cooled and before it goes into the fridge is crucial to prevent contamination. It protects the food from bacteria and other contaminants that could be present in the environment or other foods stored in the fridge.

**Common misunderstanding: Covering food is only necessary if it smells strong or might absorb odours.**

While covering food does help in preventing odour absorption, its primary purpose is to protect food from airborne contaminants and cross-contamination. Every type of food should be covered regardless of its odour.

**Common misunderstanding: Plastic wrap is the only option for covering food.**

Food can be covered with various materials, not just plastic wrap. Lids, aluminium foil, or even reusable silicone covers are effective. The key is to ensure the covering is secure and appropriate for the type of food.
