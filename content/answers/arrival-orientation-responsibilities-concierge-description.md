  A Concierge job description should clearly outline responsibilities as guests
  arrive.
---
When setting up a Concierge job description, it's important to clearly define what the concierge will do as guests arrive. This includes greeting guests, providing a thorough introduction to the hotel’s services and amenities, understanding individual guest needs and preferences, informing guests of local events and attractions, and assisting with luggage and personalised room check-in processes.

**Common misunderstanding: A concierge's job is just to greet guests.**

Greeting guests is just the start. A concierge also plays a crucial role in setting the tone for the guest's stay, providing personalised service right from the start, and ensuring all initial queries and needs are addressed.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed orientations are unnecessary if guests have visited before.**

Even returning guests appreciate a quick update on any new services or amenities and a personal touch in their welcome. It reaffirms their decision to return and enhances guest satisfaction.

## How can I differentiate roles for boutique versus large hotels?

In boutique hotels, concierge roles often involve more personalised guest interactions and may include tasks like coordinating unique local experiences or intimate dining options. In contrast, concierges in larger hotels might focus on efficiently handling a higher volume of standard guest requests and coordinating with various departments to manage services.

**Common misunderstanding: The concierge roles are the same regardless of the hotel size.**

While the core responsibilities might overlap, the scale and style of service in boutique versus large hotels can dictate significantly different daily tasks and guest interaction levels.

**Common misunderstanding: Boutique hotel concierges don’t need tech skills.**

Regardless of the hotel size, today's concierge roles often require a good level of tech-savviness to manage reservations, guest communications, and information about local attractions efficiently.

## What strategies help in effectively onboarding new guests?

Effective onboarding of new guests involves a warm welcome, a quick but thorough orientation to the hotel's facilities, and a personal touch such as addressing guests by name or providing customised recommendations based on their preferences. Ensuring all their initial questions are answered and they feel comfortable in the new environment is key.

**Common misunderstanding: A standard welcome packet is enough for all guests.**

While welcome packets are helpful, customising information based on guest preferences or reasons for their stay can significantly enhance their initial experience and satisfaction.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the check-in is complete, the concierge’s role in guest onboarding is done.**

Onboarding extends beyond check-in. Follow-ups to ensure guest satisfaction or quick responses to their initial requests can set a positive tone for the rest of their stay.
