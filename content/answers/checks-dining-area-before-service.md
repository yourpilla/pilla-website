# What checks should be done in the dining area before service begins?

Before service starts, it's key to ensure the dining area is perfectly set up to welcome guests. This includes checking that all tables are clean, stable, and fully set with menus, cutlery, and napkins. Chairs should be clean and in good repair, and floors should be free from debris and freshly mopped or vacuumed. This sets the stage for a positive dining experience and shows attention to detail, which guests always appreciate.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick visual check of the dining area is enough.**

Just looking over the dining area isn't enough. You need to physically check each element like stability of tables, cleanliness of chairs, and proper setup of each table to ensure everything is guest-ready. Small details can significantly impact a guest's experience.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to set tables without polishing cutlery and glassware first.**

Every piece of cutlery and glassware should be polished. Watermarks or leftover smudges can make guests think the cleanliness standards are low, which might deter them from returning.

## What are common cleanliness standards for cutlery and condiments?

Cutlery should be polished and free from watermarks or food residue. Condiments like salt, pepper, and sugar should be full, clean, and not sticky. Ensuring these items are spotless not only meets hygiene standards but also enhances the overall dining experience. Guests notice these details, and they can reflect on the overall quality of the restaurant.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as cutlery is washed, it doesn’t need to be polished.**

Simply washing cutlery isn't enough. Polishing is necessary to remove water spots and any remaining smudges, which ensures that the cutlery looks pristine and maintains a professional standard.

**Common misunderstanding: Refilling condiments without cleaning the containers is sufficient.**

It's important to clean condiment containers, not just refill them. Sticky or dirty containers can be off-putting to guests and can harbour bacteria, which is a health risk.

## Why is it important to check lighting and music levels before opening?

Lighting and music set the atmosphere of your restaurant. They should be adjusted to create a welcoming environment that matches the time of day and dining experience you want to offer. Proper lighting ensures that the space is inviting and functional, while music at the right volume can enhance the mood without overwhelming guests.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s fine to leave lighting and music settings as they were the night before.**

Lighting and music needs can differ significantly between night and day. Settings appropriate for a lively dinner service might be too harsh or loud for a calm breakfast crowd. Always adjust these elements to suit the service period.

**Common misunderstanding: Once set in the morning, lighting and music don’t need to be adjusted throughout the day.**

Changes in natural lighting and the transition from one meal service to another can necessitate adjustments in lighting and music levels to maintain the right atmosphere and keep guests comfortable.
