Reheated food should be served immediately after it reaches the correct internal temperature. This ensures the food is safe to eat and maintains its quality. The correct reheating temperature is a minimum of 75°C in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and 82°C in Scotland.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheated food can sit out for a while before serving.**

Leaving reheated food out can lead to a drop in temperature, allowing harmful bacteria to multiply. Serve it right away to keep it safe.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s safe to serve reheated food at any temperature as long as it’s hot.**

Food needs to reach a specific temperature to ensure all bacteria are killed. Always use a food thermometer to check that it has reached at least 75°C or 82°C depending on your location.

## Can reheated food be held before service?

Yes, but only if it is transferred immediately into pre-heated hot holding equipment after reaching the correct temperature. This equipment should keep the food at a safe temperature until it is served.

**Common misunderstanding: Any hot holding equipment can be used to keep reheated food safe.**

Only use equipment specifically designed for hot holding. Other types might not maintain the necessary temperature, risking food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Reheated food can be held indefinitely in hot holding equipment.**

Even in hot holding equipment, don’t keep reheated food for too long. Follow your local food safety guidelines to know how long you can hold food safely.

## What should be done if food is not served immediately after reheating?

If food cannot be served immediately, it must be kept in pre-heated hot holding equipment to maintain the correct temperature. If this isn’t possible, the food should be served immediately or discarded to prevent the risk of foodborne illness.

**Common misunderstanding: Food that cools down after reheating can be reheated again.**

Food must never be reheated more than once. Reheating multiple times can increase the risk of food poisoning.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to leave food out until ready to serve once it’s been reheated.**

Leaving reheated food out can allow it to enter the danger zone between 5-63°C, where bacteria can multiply quickly. Always keep it in hot holding equipment if not serving immediately.
