# Can we put hot food straight into the fridge?

No, you shouldn't put hot food directly into the fridge. Hot items can raise the temperature of the fridge, potentially affecting other stored foods and causing temperature fluctuations. This could put other foods at risk by raising them above the safe temperature of 8°C.

Additionally, putting hot food straight into the fridge can affect the cold air circulation, which is vital for maintaining consistent temperatures throughout the unit. The fridge needs proper airflow around all items to function effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to put hot food in the fridge as long as it's in a covered container.**

While covering hot food can reduce moisture loss, it doesn't prevent the heat from affecting the fridge's internal temperature. This can lead to increased energy consumption and potential spoilage of nearby items. It's best to let food cool to room temperature before refrigerating.

**Common misunderstanding: Refrigerators are designed to handle hot food without any issues.**

Refrigerators are not optimised for cooling hot items rapidly. Placing hot food inside can raise the internal temperature, leading to inefficient cooling and increased energy use. This can compromise food safety for all items stored within.

## How long should we wait before putting cooked food in the fridge?

You should allow food to cool to room temperature before placing it in the fridge. Once cooled, make sure to store it in proper food-grade containers with appropriate covers - never use tea towels or cloths as covers.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to leave cooked food out overnight to cool before refrigerating.**

Leaving food out overnight poses a significant risk as it exceeds the 4-hour safe limit at room temperature. Harmful bacteria can rapidly multiply, leading to food-borne illnesses. It's crucial to refrigerate food within two hours of cooking.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a fan to cool food faster before refrigerating is completely safe.**

While using a fan can help cool food faster, it can also blow contaminants onto the food if not done in a controlled environment. It's more effective and safer to divide food into smaller portions to speed up cooling.

## What happens if we accidentally put something hot in the fridge?

If hot food has been placed in the fridge, you'll need to monitor the fridge temperature closely. If the air temperature rises above 5°C, check it again in an hour. If it remains above 5°C, you'll need to check the temperature of the food itself using a clean, sanitised probe thermometer. Any high-risk foods that have been above 8°C for more than 4 hours will need to be discarded.

**Common misunderstanding: If hot food is accidentally placed in the fridge, everything inside will be fine as long as the door remains closed.**

Even with the door closed, hot food can raise the internal temperature, putting all items at risk, especially those stored at the edges of the safe temperature range. Immediate corrective actions, such as removing the hot item and monitoring fridge temperatures, are necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the fridge temperature returns to normal, everything stored inside is safe to consume.**

Returning to normal temperatures doesn't ensure safety if food has been exposed to unsafe temperatures for extended periods. Always check for any high-risk foods that might have been compromised and follow the four-hour rule for food safety.
