No, you should reject any frozen deliveries that show signs of defrosting or refreezing. This can seriously affect food quality through freezer burn when the product is refrozen. The target temperature for frozen deliveries should be -18°C or slightly below, and you should never accept deliveries above -15°C.

Make sure to check between packs with a clean, sanitised probe thermometer (without piercing packaging) to verify the temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: If frozen food is still cold to the touch, it's safe to accept the delivery even if it appears partially defrosted.**

The tactility of the product is not a reliable indicator of its safety. The temperature at which the food is stored is crucial in preserving its safety and quality. Even if the food feels cold, it may have been exposed to temperatures that allow bacterial growth. Always use a thermometer to ensure the temperature meets safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to refreeze food items if they have only thawed slightly during delivery.**

Refreezing partially defrosted items can lead to significant degradation in food quality, including texture changes and freezer burn. Additionally, any bacteria that began to grow during the thawing process won't be killed by refreezing, which can pose a safety risk. Always reject items that do not meet the required temperature upon delivery.

## What if only one or two items in the delivery look partially defrosted but everything else is fine?

You should still reject those specific items even if the rest of the delivery is acceptable. Any stock that fails to meet temperature specifications or quality standards must be rejected at the point of delivery. Make sure to contact your supplier about the rejected items.

Label the rejected items clearly as "not for consumption" and store them separately while awaiting disposal or return to prevent any risk to other products.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the majority of the delivery is within the correct temperature range, the entire shipment is safe to accept.**

Each item in a delivery must independently meet safety and quality standards. Accepting partially defrosted items can lead to contamination risks that affect other products. It's essential to evaluate and reject any item that doesn't meet the necessary temperature conditions to ensure overall food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: If only a few items are partially defrosted, they can be used immediately to avoid waste.**

Using items that have been partially defrosted can still pose health risks if bacteria have begun to grow. Immediate use does not guarantee safety. It's safer to reject these items and communicate with the supplier for replacements to maintain food safety standards.

## The delivery driver says it will still be fine if we put it straight in the freezer - should we accept it?

No, you should not accept the driver's assurance. Maintaining the cold chain is critical for food safety. Once frozen food has started to defrost, the quality and safety can be compromised. Verbal assurances are not acceptable - you must follow proper food safety protocols and reject any frozen deliveries that don't meet the required specifications.

**Common misunderstanding: A delivery driver's experience and verbal assurance are sufficient to guarantee the safety of the food.**

While delivery drivers may have experience, food safety relies on objective measures rather than subjective assurances. The cold chain must be rigorously maintained, and only deliveries that meet specified temperature requirements should be accepted. Always verify temperatures independently to ensure compliance with safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: If food is immediately placed back in the freezer upon delivery, it negates any temporary temperature deviations during transit.**

Once the cold chain is broken, even temporarily, the integrity of the food can be compromised. Bacterial growth can occur during these temperature deviations, and simply refreezing the items does not reverse this risk. It's essential to reject deliveries that do not maintain constant, safe temperatures throughout transit.
