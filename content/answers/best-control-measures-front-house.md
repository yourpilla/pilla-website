# How do I choose the best control measures for front of house risks?

Choosing the right control measures for front of house risks involves understanding the specific hazards and how they can affect your staff and customers. Think about reducing the likelihood of the hazard occurring and minimizing the impact if it does happen. For example, if slippery floors are a concern, consider anti-slip mats or better footwear for staff.

**Common misunderstanding: All control measures are expensive and complicated to implement.**

Not all safety measures need to be costly or complex. Simple actions like rearranging furniture to avoid trip hazards or using visible signage can be highly effective and easy to implement.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a control measure is set, it doesn’t need to be reviewed.**

Control measures should be reviewed regularly, especially if there are changes in the layout, staff, or the type of service provided. This ensures they remain effective and relevant to current conditions.

## How do I judge if a front of house hazard is serious enough to act on?

To determine the seriousness of a front of house hazard, consider both the likelihood of the hazard leading to an incident and the potential severity of the outcome. For instance, a wet floor might be a common issue, but its potential to cause a serious fall makes it a high-priority hazard.

**Common misunderstanding: Minor hazards don’t need immediate action.**

Even seemingly minor hazards can lead to serious incidents, especially in a busy restaurant environment. It’s important to address all identified risks promptly to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Only hazards that have previously caused accidents are serious.**

Do not wait for an incident to occur to take action. Proactively managing potential hazards can prevent accidents and improve the overall safety of your front of house area.

## What makes a good control measure for front of house environments?

A good control measure for front of house should effectively reduce the risk of the hazard, be easy for staff to follow, and fit seamlessly into the daily operations without causing significant disruption. For example, ensuring that all walkways are kept clear and marking steps clearly can prevent trips and falls.

**Common misunderstanding: Good control measures need to be innovative or high-tech.**

Effective control measures often involve simple and straightforward solutions that are easy to implement and maintain. Consistency and clarity are more important than complexity.

**Common misunderstanding: Control measures can be standard across all restaurants.**

Each restaurant has unique challenges based on its layout, customer flow, and type of service. Tailor your control measures to fit the specific needs and risks of your front of house area.
