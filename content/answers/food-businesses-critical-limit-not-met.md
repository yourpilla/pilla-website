# What should food businesses do when a critical limit is not met?

When a critical limit in a HACCP plan is not met, food businesses must immediately take corrective action to prevent any potential food safety hazards. This could involve stopping the production line, discarding the affected product, or adjusting the process to bring it back within safe limits. It's essential to address these issues quickly to ensure the safety of the food being served.

**Common misunderstanding: If a critical limit is breached, it can be adjusted on the fly without formal documentation.**

Adjusting critical limits without proper validation and documentation undermines the integrity of the HACCP system. All changes must be scientifically justified and recorded to maintain food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Minor breaches in critical limits don’t require immediate action.**

Even minor deviations can lead to significant food safety risks. Immediate corrective actions are crucial to prevent any potential health hazards, regardless of the perceived severity of the breach.

## Why is it important to take corrective action and record it?

Taking corrective action when a critical limit is not met is crucial to prevent unsafe food from reaching consumers. Recording these actions is equally important as it provides a traceable history of what was done to correct the issue. This documentation helps in identifying recurring problems and demonstrates compliance with food safety regulations, which is vital during inspections.

**Common misunderstanding: Corrective actions are only necessary for major safety violations.**

All deviations from critical limits, no matter how small, require corrective actions to maintain the safety and quality of food products.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording corrective actions is unnecessary if the problem is fixed immediately.**

Without proper documentation, there’s no proof that an issue was identified and corrected, which is critical for both internal audits and regulatory compliance.

## How does Pilla help escalate HACCP issues effectively?

Pilla provides a digital platform that simplifies the process of managing HACCP systems. It allows staff to quickly report and escalate issues directly through the app. This immediate reporting capability includes options to attach photos and comments, which helps in faster resolution of issues and ensures that all relevant details are captured for review.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital tools like Pilla are only useful for large businesses.**
