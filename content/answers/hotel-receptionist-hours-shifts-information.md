# What hours and shifts information should I include in a Hotel Receptionist job description?

When writing a job description for a Hotel Receptionist, it's important to clearly state the hours and shifts they will be expected to work. This helps potential candidates understand their work schedule and assess if it fits their personal commitments. Include details about the shift patterns (morning, afternoon, night), the expected number of hours per week, and any requirements for weekends or holidays.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s sufficient to just mention full-time or part-time.**

Simply stating "full-time" or "part-time" is not enough. Candidates need to know specific shift times and patterns to decide if the job suits their lifestyle. Detailed shift information prevents misunderstandings and attracts candidates who are genuinely able to commit to the schedule.

**Common misunderstanding: Specific shift details can be discussed after hiring.**

Waiting until after hiring to discuss specific shift details can lead to dissatisfaction and high turnover. Providing these details upfront ensures that only candidates who are comfortable with the hours will apply, which helps in retaining staff.

## Should I mention early, late, and weekend shifts in the description?

Yes, you should definitely mention if the job involves early mornings, late evenings, or weekend shifts. Being transparent about these requirements helps in attracting applicants who are already willing and able to work these hours. This clarity can also enhance the employer's reputation for being open and honest, which is attractive to potential employees.

**Common misunderstanding: Mentioning undesirable shifts might deter applicants.**

While it's true that some candidates might be deterred by early, late, or weekend shifts, it's better to be upfront. This way, you ensure that those who do apply are more likely to stay in the role, as they are aware of the requirements from the start.

**Common misunderstanding: Flexible shifts imply irregular hours.**

Clarifying that shifts might include early, late, or weekend hours doesn't necessarily mean they are irregular. You can still offer regular, scheduled shifts that occur at these times, which should be clearly communicated to avoid confusion.

## How much detail do applicants want about scheduling flexibility?

Applicants generally appreciate knowing as much as possible about scheduling flexibility. This includes details on shift swapping, possibilities for choosing preferred shifts, and any options for remote work if applicable. Providing this information can make the position more attractive to potential candidates who value work-life balance.

**Common misunderstanding: Flexibility means lack of structure.**

Some employers worry that highlighting flexibility can give the impression of a chaotic work environment. However, when properly managed, flexibility can be a structured part of the job that helps staff manage their work and personal life more effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: All applicants prefer a flexible schedule.**

Not all candidates seek flexibility. Some might prefer having fixed hours that don’t change. It’s important to communicate the nature of the flexibility offered, whether it’s optional or a required part of the job, to attract the right candidates.
