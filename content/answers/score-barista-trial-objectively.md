# How do I score a Barista trial objectively?

When you're running a Barista trial, it's important to use a structured scoring system. This helps you fairly assess each candidate's skills and attitude. Use a simple scorecard where you can rate various aspects like espresso making, milk handling, cleanliness, and customer interaction. Each category should have a clear pass or needs improvement option.

**Common misunderstanding: Scoring based on gut feeling is enough.**

Reliance on gut feeling can lead to inconsistent and biased decisions. It's better to use a structured scorecard that focuses on specific criteria. This way, you ensure that all candidates are evaluated equally and based on the same standards.

**Common misunderstanding: A perfect score in one area can compensate for poor performance in others.**

It's important to consider all areas of the scorecard. A candidate who excels in making espresso but lacks in hygiene or customer service might not be the right fit, especially if your café prides itself on cleanliness and customer interaction.

## What does a simple Barista trial scorecard look like?

A simple Barista trial scorecard should include key areas such as espresso taste and consistency, milk texture and pouring technique, station cleanliness and organisation, and service attitude and friendliness. Each area can be marked as 'Pass' or 'Needs Development' based on the candidate's performance during the trial.

**Common misunderstanding: More categories on the scorecard mean better evaluation.**

Adding too many categories can complicate the scoring process. Focus on essential skills and attributes that reflect your café's needs. This keeps the evaluation process straightforward and relevant.

**Common misunderstanding: The scorecard results are the only factors to consider when hiring.**

While the scorecard is a crucial tool, also consider how the candidate fits with your team and their potential to grow with your business. Observations outside the scorecard can be equally important.

## What are signs of good Barista hygiene and service attitude?

Good Barista hygiene includes maintaining a clean workstation, properly using sanitisation tools, and following food safety protocols. A positive service attitude is shown by friendly customer interactions, the ability to handle stress gracefully, and proactive communication with both customers and team members.

**Common misunderstanding: If a Barista is friendly, it’s okay if their hygiene standards slip a little.**

Hygiene is non-negotiable in a food service environment. Even the friendliest Barista needs to maintain strict cleanliness to ensure food safety and customer health.

**Common misunderstanding: Experienced Baristas don’t need to demonstrate basic hygiene during trials.**

Every Barista, regardless of experience, should demonstrate fundamental hygiene practices during a trial. This reassures that they prioritize safety and cleanliness, which are critical for any food service role.
