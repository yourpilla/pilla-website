# How often should I check the freezer temperature?

You should check and record freezer temperatures twice per day. The ideal temperature should be -18째C (0째F) or below.

## Do I need to document the freezer temperature if the temperature is within range?

Yes absolutely, you still need to document the freezer temperature. By doing this you are documenting that the freezer is working correctly and this is important to show food hygiene inspectors when they arrive.
