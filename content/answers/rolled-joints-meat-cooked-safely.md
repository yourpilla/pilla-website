Rolled joints of meat, including beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and turkey, must be cooked thoroughly to ensure they are safe to eat. To cook these meats safely, you should cook them until the juices run clear and there is no pinkness inside. Use a clean, disinfected food probe to check that the internal temperature has reached a safe level throughout the product.

**Common misunderstanding: Rolled joints only need to be browned on the outside to be safe to eat.**

Browning the outside of rolled joints does not ensure the inside is safe. The entire joint must reach the correct internal temperature to eliminate harmful bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking times are the same for rolled and whole cuts of meat.**

Rolled joints often require longer cooking times than whole cuts because bacteria from the surface can be mixed throughout the meat during the rolling process.

## Why are rolled joints higher risk than whole cuts?

Rolled joints of meat are considered higher risk because the process of rolling can transfer bacteria from the outer surface to the inside of the meat. This internal contamination means that the entire joint must reach the required cooking temperature to ensure safety, unlike whole cuts where primarily the external surface needs thorough cooking.

**Common misunderstanding: If the exterior of a rolled joint is cooked, the interior is safe.**

The exterior cooking does not guarantee the interior reaches the necessary temperatures to kill bacteria. The entire joint must be uniformly cooked.

**Common misunderstanding: Rolled joints and whole cuts can be cooked using the same methods and timing.**

Rolled joints require more careful cooking and often longer times than whole cuts due to potential internal contamination.

## How can I verify that rolled joints have reached a safe temperature?

To verify that rolled joints have reached a safe internal temperature, use a sanitised food thermometer to probe the thickest part of the meat. Ensure the temperature reaches at least 75째C (167째F) for at least 30 seconds. This temperature and time combination is crucial for ensuring all harmful bacteria are destroyed.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the temperature at any point of the meat is sufficient.**

It's important to check the temperature at the thickest part of the joint, as this is the last part to reach the required temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick temperature check is enough to ensure safety.**

Make sure the thermometer is held in the meat long enough to get a stable reading, ensuring the entire joint has reached and maintained the required temperature for the necessary time.
