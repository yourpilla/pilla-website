When setting up a cleaning schedule for your restaurant's front of house (FOH), focus on areas that guests will notice immediately or that could pose hygiene risks. Start by identifying what guests see first and what they touch. Tasks like wiping down tables and sanitising door handles should be top priority because they impact guest experience and safety directly.

**Common misunderstanding: All cleaning tasks have the same priority.**

Not all cleaning tasks are created equal. High-touch areas or those directly in guest view should be cleaned more frequently to maintain hygiene and guest trust. Lower visibility areas might not need the same frequency.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning only needs to focus on end-of-day tasks.**

While deep cleaning is important at the end of the day, maintaining cleanliness throughout the day is crucial. This prevents build-up and ensures that your space is always presentable and hygienic for every guest.

## What are examples of high-visibility guest areas that must be cleaned regularly?

High-visibility areas in a restaurant include the entrance, host stand, dining tables, and bar counters. These areas are constantly under the scrutiny of guests. For example, ensuring that the entrance is free of smudges and the host stand is tidy and organised sets a positive first impression. Regularly cleaning these areas reassures guests about your establishment's cleanliness standards.

**Common misunderstanding: If it looks clean, it is clean.**

Visual cleanliness is important, but germs and bacteria that pose health risks can't be seen. Regular sanitising, not just tidying, is crucial.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning once a day is enough for high-traffic areas.**

High-traffic areas might need cleaning multiple times a day because they accumulate dirt and germs faster, especially during peak hours.

## Why are customer toilets and table surfaces considered high-impact FOH cleaning zones?

Customer toilets and table surfaces are critical because they directly impact guest perceptions and hygiene. Toilets are a private space where guests will notice cleanliness immediately, and any lapse can affect their overall impression of your restaurant. Table surfaces are constantly in use and are high-contact points, making regular sanitisation essential to prevent the spread of germs.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the toilets look clean, they are fine.**

Appearance is important, but toilets need to be sanitised thoroughly, not just wiped down, to ensure they are hygienic.

**Common misunderstanding: Table cleaning can be superficial between guests.**

Tables should be sanitised, not just wiped. This means using the right cleaning agents and techniques to remove germs effectively, especially during busy periods.
