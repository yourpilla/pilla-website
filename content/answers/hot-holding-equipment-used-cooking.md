Hot holding equipment, like bain-maries, is designed to keep already cooked food at a safe temperature before it's served. It's not suitable for cooking because it doesn't reach high enough temperatures to destroy harmful bacteria in uncooked food. This means using it for cooking can lead to foodborne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: Hot holding equipment can be used for cooking if the food is left in it for a longer period.**

Even if food is left in hot holding equipment for a long time, it won't reach the temperatures needed to safely cook food. The equipment is only meant to keep cooked food warm.

**Common misunderstanding: All heating equipment works the same for cooking and holding food.**

Different equipment is designed for specific purposes. Cooking requires equipment that can reach higher temperatures to ensure all bacteria are killed, which hot holding equipment isn't capable of achieving.

## What is the proper use of hot holding equipment?

Hot holding equipment should only be used to keep cooked foods at a safe temperature, typically above 63°C, until they are ready to be served. This prevents the growth of harmful bacteria that can occur if the food temperature drops below this threshold.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to occasionally use hot holding equipment for warming up cold foods.**

Warming up cold foods in hot holding equipment is risky because it doesn't achieve the temperatures needed to make cold foods safe from bacteria. Always reheat food using appropriate cooking equipment before placing it in hot holding.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the food is hot, it's safe to place in hot holding equipment.**

Food needs to be properly cooked to a safe internal temperature before it can be placed in hot holding. Simply being 'hot' isn't enough to ensure all bacteria have been killed.

## What happens if food is only cooked using hot holding equipment?

If food is only cooked using hot holding equipment, it likely won't reach the necessary internal temperature to kill harmful bacteria, leading to an increased risk of foodborne illnesses. This method of "cooking" can leave bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli intact, which can cause serious health issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Food looks cooked so it must be safe.**

Appearance can be deceiving. Food might look cooked on the outside but still be raw and dangerous on the inside if not cooked at the right temperatures. Always use a food thermometer to check.

**Common misunderstanding: Using hot holding equipment for a longer time will eventually cook the food safely.**

Extending the time food is kept in hot holding equipment doesn't compensate for the lower temperatures. Proper cooking equipment must be used to reach safe cooking temperatures.
