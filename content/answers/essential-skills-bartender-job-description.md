---
When writing a job description for a bartender, it's important to list skills that are directly related to the daily responsibilities of the role. Essential skills might include mixology proficiency, customer service excellence, and the ability to manage cash and inventory efficiently. These skills ensure that the bartender can handle the core aspects of their job effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: All bartenders need to have experience with every type of drink preparation.**

While a broad knowledge of drink recipes is beneficial, focus on the specific types of drinks your establishment serves. For example, a craft beer pub might prioritise knowledge of local brews over cocktail preparation.

**Common misunderstanding: Advanced skills like flair bartending are essential for all bartenders.**

Flair bartending skills are impressive but are usually not essential unless your bar specifically focuses on entertainment-based service. Prioritise skills that match your bar's atmosphere and customer service style.

## How do I choose between essential and desirable skills?

Essential skills are non-negotiable and must be possessed by the candidate from the outset, as these are critical for daily operations. Desirable skills, however, are beneficial but not mandatory and can be developed over time. For instance, essential skills might include basic cocktail knowledge and POS system operation, while desirable skills could include experience in creating signature drinks or a deeper knowledge of wine varieties.

**Common misunderstanding: Desirable skills are just nice-to-have and not very important.**

While not immediately critical, desirable skills can enhance a bartender's performance and provide added value to your business. These skills can differentiate between a good candidate and a great one.

**Common misunderstanding: Candidates must have all the desirable skills to be considered for the role.**

Desirable skills should not be deal-breakers. They are areas for potential growth and can help in future development but are not essential for job performance at the hiring stage.

## What examples of hard and soft skills work best?

Hard skills for bartenders include mixology, operation of bar equipment, and cash handling. These are teachable and measurable abilities. Soft skills, which are equally important, include communication, teamwork, and adaptability, ensuring the bartender works well under pressure and can provide excellent customer service.

**Common misunderstanding: Hard skills are more important than soft skills.**

While hard skills are crucial for the technical aspects of bartending, soft skills are essential for creating a positive customer experience and working effectively with the team. Both sets of skills are crucial for a well-rounded bartender.

**Common misunderstanding: Soft skills are difficult to assess and therefore not necessary to list in the job description.**

Soft skills can be assessed through behavioural interview questions and practical assessments. Listing them in the job description helps attract candidates who not only have the technical skills but also the personality fit for your team's dynamics and customer service style.
