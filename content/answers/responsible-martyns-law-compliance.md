  Responsibility for Martyn's Law compliance typically falls to key figures such

  business.
---
In any hospitality business, the owner, licensee, general manager, or event organiser usually takes on the role of the "Responsible Person" for Martyn's Law compliance. This person is in charge of ensuring that the venue meets its security duties under the law. For larger companies, this responsibility might be assigned to a senior manager or a designated compliance team.

**Common misunderstanding: Only security personnel need to worry about Martyn's Law compliance.**

While security staff play a crucial role, Martyn's Law compliance is a broader responsibility that includes assessing risks, creating security plans, and training all staff. It's a top-down initiative that requires involvement from the highest levels of management.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance with Martyn's Law is a one-time task.**

Compliance is an ongoing process that involves regular updates to security plans, continuous staff training, and staying informed about new threats. It's not just about setting up procedures but also about maintaining and improving them.

## What is the role of the Responsible Person?

The Responsible Person under Martyn's Law is tasked with overseeing the venue's adherence to the required security measures. This includes registering the venue with the Security Industry Authority (SIA), developing terrorism response plans, and ensuring all staff are trained on these procedures. They must also keep documentation up to date and engage with the SIA during inspections or audits.

**Common misunderstanding: The Responsible Person needs to be a security expert.**

While having a background in security can be helpful, the key responsibilities involve management skills and the ability to coordinate security efforts across the venue. Training and resources are available to help the Responsible Person understand their duties.

**Common misunderstanding: The Responsible Person handles everything on their own.**

Effective compliance often involves delegating tasks to other team members or departments, such as HR for training or facilities for physical security measures. The Responsible Person coordinates these efforts but doesn't necessarily execute every task personally.

## What is the role of a Designated Senior Officer for large businesses?

In larger organisations, a Designated Senior Officer (DSO) is appointed to oversee Martyn's Law compliance across multiple venues or within a large venue. This senior-level manager ensures that all aspects of the law are integrated into the business's operations and that compliance measures are supported by the necessary resources and policies.

**Common misunderstanding: The DSO's role is only administrative.**

While the DSO does handle a lot of documentation and coordination, their role also involves strategic decision-making about security measures and policies. They play a crucial role in shaping the security culture of the organisation.

**Common misunderstanding: A DSO is only required for businesses with multiple venues.**

A DSO may also be necessary for a single but very large venue that faces complex security challenges. The role is about managing scale and complexity, not just the number of properties.
