# What legal or compliance information belongs in a Bartender job description?

When writing a job description for a bartender, it's important to include specific legal and compliance details to ensure both you and the potential candidates understand the legal requirements. This includes any necessary certifications, health and safety regulations, and legal obligations related to serving alcohol.

**Common misunderstanding: Itâ€™s enough to just mention that the job involves serving alcohol.**

Simply stating that the job involves alcohol isn't sufficient. You must specify any legal certifications or training required, such as holding a valid alcohol serving certificate or completing a responsible service of alcohol course.

**Common misunderstanding: Compliance details can be discussed after hiring.**

It's crucial to outline compliance requirements in the job description to attract candidates who are already qualified or willing to meet these standards before they apply, ensuring a smoother hiring process and compliance with the law from day one.

## Do I need to mention age restrictions or licensing requirements?

Yes, mentioning age restrictions and licensing requirements is essential. In many places, there are legal age limits for serving alcohol, and bartenders may need specific licenses. Clearly stating these requirements helps prevent applications from those who are not legally eligible to work as bartenders.

**Common misunderstanding: Age restrictions are the same for all hospitality jobs.**

Age restrictions can vary significantly between different types of hospitality roles, especially in roles involving alcohol. Always specify the legal age requirement for serving alcohol in your location.

**Common misunderstanding: All bartenders need the same type of license.**

Licensing requirements can differ based on the location and the type of establishment. Specify whether your venue requires a special bartender license or if a general hospitality license is sufficient.

## How do I show candidates we take food and alcohol safety seriously?

To demonstrate your commitment to food and alcohol safety in your job description, highlight any relevant training programs you offer, such as food handling certifications or alcohol responsibility courses. Also, mention your establishment's policies on these matters and how strictly they are enforced.

**Common misunderstanding: Safety training is only for kitchen staff.**

While kitchen staff certainly need safety training, bartenders also handle consumables and therefore must be trained in food and alcohol safety to prevent contamination and ensure safe service.

**Common misunderstanding: Mentioning safety makes the job seem less appealing.**

On the contrary, emphasizing a commitment to safety standards can attract candidates who value professionalism and wish to work in a responsible, reputable environment.
