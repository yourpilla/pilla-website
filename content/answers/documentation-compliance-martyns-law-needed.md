  Under Martyn's Law, all venues are required to maintain essential
  documentation to demonstrate legal compliance.
---
Under Martyn's Law, venues must maintain specific documentation to show they're meeting legal requirements. This includes a written security plan, risk assessments, training records, and incident logs. For enhanced-tier venues, this documentation must be submitted to the Security Industry Authority (SIA) regulator.

**Common misunderstanding: Only large venues need to keep detailed security documentation.**

While it's true that larger venues have more complex requirements, all venues covered by Martyn's Law must maintain some form of documentation. This ensures that even smaller venues can demonstrate their compliance during inspections or audits.

**Common misunderstanding: Once documentation is submitted, no further updates are necessary.**

Security needs can change, and so should your documentation. Regular updates to reflect new threats, changes in venue layout, or updates in emergency procedures are crucial to remain compliant and ensure safety.

## Why is keeping training records and procedures important?

Training records and documented procedures are vital for ensuring that all staff are prepared to respond to a terrorist attack effectively. These documents prove that staff have been trained according to the requirements of Martyn's Law and know what to do in an emergency.

**Common misunderstanding: Training only needs to be conducted once.**

Security training is not a one-time event. Regular refreshers and updates are necessary to keep staff prepared, especially with high turnover rates in the hospitality industry. Continuous training helps maintain a high level of readiness and compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: Informal training is sufficient under Martyn's Law.**

Martyn's Law requires documented proof of training. Informal or undocumented training sessions might not be considered valid during an inspection or audit. Formal, recorded training ensures that all legal standards are met and that records are available to prove compliance.

## How can venues organise their security documentation effectively?

Effective organisation of security documentation involves regular updates, easy accessibility for staff, and clear categorisation of documents such as risk assessments, emergency procedures, and training logs. Using digital systems to store and manage these documents can enhance security and ease of access.

Digital records offer better security, easier updates, and quicker access in emergencies. They also reduce the risk of physical damage or loss.

**Common misunderstanding: All staff should have access to all security documents.**

Access to sensitive security information should be controlled. Only staff who need to know should have access to detailed security plans, to prevent misuse of information and enhance overall security.
