Use a walk-in fridge to finish cooling hot food if you're approaching the 90-minute time limit and the food hasn't cooled sufficiently. This method helps ensure that the food reaches a safe storage temperature quickly without raising the temperature inside the fridge.

**Common misunderstanding: You can use a walk-in fridge at any time during the cooling process.**

It's best to use other cooling methods first to bring the temperature down as much as possible before placing food in a walk-in fridge. This prevents the fridge's temperature from rising and affecting other stored food.

**Common misunderstanding: Walk-in fridges can cool any amount of hot food quickly without any risk.**

Even walk-in fridges have limits. Overloading them with hot food can raise the internal temperature, risking food safety. Always monitor the fridge temperature when adding large quantities of hot food.

## Why shouldn't I use a normal free-standing fridge to cool hot food?

Placing hot food directly into a normal free-standing fridge can raise the fridge's internal temperature, putting all stored food at risk of bacterial growth if the temperature goes above 8°C. This method can also strain the fridge's cooling system, potentially leading to breakdowns.

**Common misunderstanding: If the fridge seems to handle it, it's okay to cool hot food this way.**

Even if your fridge continues to function, temporarily elevated temperatures can still allow bacteria to multiply on all the food inside, not just the hot items. Always cool food by other methods before refrigerating.

**Common misunderstanding: The size of the hot food doesn't matter when cooling in a free-standing fridge.**

The size and amount of hot food can significantly impact the temperature inside a fridge. Larger or more quantities of hot food can cause more substantial temperature increases, posing a greater risk.

## What precautions should I take when moving food to a walk-in fridge for cooling?

Before moving food to a walk-in fridge for cooling, ensure it's no longer hot to the touch and is loosely covered to protect against contamination. Also, check that the fridge is not overloaded and has good air circulation to effectively cool the food.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to stack hot food tightly in the walk-in fridge to save space.**

Stacking hot food tightly can restrict airflow and insulate the heat, preventing it from cooling effectively. Always space out food items to allow air to circulate freely.

**Common misunderstanding: You can cover the food tightly when placing it in the walk-in fridge.**

Covering food tightly can trap heat and moisture, slowing down the cooling process. Use loose covers to protect the food while still allowing heat to escape.
