Updating your cleaning schedule is key to maintaining high standards in your hospitality business. Start by reviewing the current effectiveness and gather feedback from your team. Look for patterns in missed tasks and areas that need more attention, then adjust the schedule accordingly to cover all necessary aspects of cleanliness.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a cleaning schedule is set, it doesn’t need to be changed unless there’s a problem.**

Regular updates are important, even if no immediate issues are apparent. Changes in season, menu, or staff can affect the cleaning needs of your establishment. Regularly revisiting the schedule ensures it remains relevant and effective.

**Common misunderstanding: More frequent cleaning is the only way to improve cleanliness.**

While frequency is important, the quality of cleaning and the specific tasks involved are just as crucial. Focus on training staff properly for each task and using the right tools and products, which can improve overall cleanliness without necessarily increasing the frequency of cleaning.

## When should you review your cleaning schedule?

Review your cleaning schedule at least quarterly. Additionally, consider a review if there’s a change in operations, such as a new menu, renovation, or feedback from health inspections. This ensures that your cleaning tasks remain aligned with the needs of your business and maintain compliance with health standards.

**Common misunderstanding: You only need to review your cleaning schedule when there’s a visible issue.**

Waiting for problems to appear before reviewing your cleaning schedule can lead to bigger issues, such as health code violations or customer complaints. Proactive reviews help prevent problems and maintain a consistently high standard of cleanliness.

**Common misunderstanding: Reviews should only be done annually.**

An annual review might not be sufficient to catch all issues or adapt to changes in the business environment. More frequent reviews allow for quicker adjustments and can be crucial for maintaining high standards.

## What should you ask your team during a cleaning review?

During a cleaning review, ask your team about challenges they face with the current schedule, areas they think need more attention, and suggestions for improving cleaning practices. This feedback is invaluable for making practical adjustments that help maintain a clean and safe environment.

**Common misunderstanding: The manager should decide on changes to the cleaning schedule without team input.**

Input from the team is crucial as they are the ones carrying out the tasks. Their insights can reveal practical issues and areas for improvement that might not be obvious from a management perspective.

**Common misunderstanding: Feedback should only be about problems.**

While identifying problems is important, feedback should also highlight what works well. Understanding successful aspects of your current cleaning schedule can help you reinforce these practices and apply them more broadly.

## How can cleaning tasks, tools, and instructions be improved over time?

Improving cleaning tasks, tools, and instructions involves staying updated with the latest cleaning technologies and products, training staff regularly, and adapting the tasks to better suit the environment and type of dirt or debris encountered. Regularly assess the effectiveness of tools and methods, and be open to adopting new practices that could enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a cleaning method is established, it doesn’t need to be updated.**

Cleaning technologies and best practices evolve. Sticking to outdated methods can lead to less efficient cleaning and higher costs over time. Regular updates can lead to more effective cleaning and often, cost savings.

**Common misunderstanding: New tools and products are always better.**

While new tools and products can offer improvements, they should be evaluated critically before being implemented. Not every new product will be suitable for your specific needs. Trial and evaluation are key steps in deciding whether a new tool or product will actually benefit your cleaning processes.
