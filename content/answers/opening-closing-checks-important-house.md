# Why are opening and closing checks important for front of house staff?

Opening and closing checks are crucial because they ensure that everything is ready for guests and that the venue is secure after they leave. These checks help maintain high standards of cleanliness, safety, and service, which are essential for a good customer experience and for the reputation of the business.

**Common misunderstanding: Checks are just a formality and don't need much attention.**

It's important to understand that these checks are not just routine; they prevent potential issues that could affect guest satisfaction and safety. Skipping them can lead to problems during service, which might not only upset guests but also lead to more serious compliance issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Only senior staff need to worry about these checks.**

Every member of the front of house team plays a role in these checks. It's a collective effort to ensure that the dining area, bar, and other guest-facing zones meet the required standards. Training all staff on how to perform these checks thoroughly ensures consistency and accountability.

## What common issues can occur if opening checks are skipped?

If opening checks are not done, you might face several issues such as dirty tables, malfunctioning equipment, or even safety hazards, all of which can negatively impact the guest experience and increase the risk of complaints or health and safety issues.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to skip checks on slow days.**

Even on slow days, skipping checks can lead to unexpected problems. Issues like unclean toilets, unswept floors, or unstocked condiments can suddenly become apparent when a guest encounters them, leading to a poor impression and potential negative reviews.

**Common misunderstanding: Quick visual checks are enough.**

Quick visual checks often miss smaller, critical details like the cleanliness of cutlery or the functionality of service equipment. Detailed checks are necessary to catch these issues before they affect service.

## How can you ensure front of house areas give a strong first impression?

To make a strong first impression, ensure that the front of house areas are impeccably clean, well-organised, and welcoming. This includes having clean signage, tidy and accessible entrance areas, and well-prepared staff ready to greet guests warmly.

**Common misunderstanding: First impressions are only about aesthetics.**

While clean and attractive visuals are crucial, first impressions also involve the efficiency and readiness of the service. For example, ensuring menus are up-to-date and tills are working properly are as important as having a clean entrance.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the interior matters for first impressions.**

The external appearance of your venue is just as important. Dirty or cluttered exteriors, unlit signage, or untidy outdoor seating areas can deter guests before they even step inside. Always include external areas in your opening checks.
