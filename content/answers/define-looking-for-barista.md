  To define what you're looking for in a Barista, start by listing all the
  essential skills and traits required for the role.
---
Before you start the hiring process, it's crucial to clearly define the skills and traits you need in a Barista. This helps you focus your interview questions and practical tests on what truly matters for your café. Start by listing all the qualities and skills you think a Barista should have, then categorise them into 'must-have' and 'nice-to-have'.

**Common misunderstanding: All traits are equally important for a Barista.**

Not all traits are critical. Some, like basic coffee-making skills, are essential ('must-have'), while others, like latte art, might be 'nice-to-have' depending on your café's focus. Prioritising these helps streamline the hiring process.

**Common misunderstanding: Defining traits is a one-time task.**

Your café's needs may evolve, so it's important to revisit and adjust the traits you're looking for in a Barista as your business grows or changes. What was once a 'nice-to-have' might become a 'must-have' as your customer base or menu evolves.

## What are examples of must-have and nice-to-have traits?

Must-have traits are non-negotiable skills or qualities that a Barista needs to perform effectively in your café. For example, the ability to work fast under pressure and excellent customer service skills are typically must-haves. Nice-to-have traits, like knowledge of espresso calibration or latte art skills, enhance a Barista's role but aren't essential for basic operations.

**Common misunderstanding: Nice-to-have traits don't matter.**

While not critical, nice-to-have traits can differentiate a good Barista from a great one, especially in competitive or niche markets. They can also be a deciding factor when choosing between two similarly qualified candidates.

**Common misunderstanding: Must-have traits are the same for all cafés.**

Must-have traits can vary significantly depending on the type of café and its clientele. A busy city café might prioritize speed and efficiency, while a boutique coffee shop might focus more on detailed coffee knowledge and customer interaction.

## Why should I fill out a Barista requirements table before interviewing?

Filling out a Barista requirements table helps you clarify and organize the essential and desirable traits you're looking for. This preparation ensures you remain focused during the interview process and assess candidates against consistent standards. It also aids in crafting questions and scenarios that directly test for these traits.

**Common misunderstanding: The requirements table is just a formality.**

It's a strategic tool, not just paperwork. By clearly defining what you're looking for, you can more effectively communicate expectations to candidates and evaluate their suitability for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: A requirements table limits flexibility in hiring.**

On the contrary, it provides a clear framework within which you can make informed decisions. This doesn't prevent you from recognizing unique talents or potential in candidates that might not exactly fit the predefined criteria.
