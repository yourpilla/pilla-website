---
When conducting a kitchen risk assessment, it's crucial to include control measures that address the specific hazards identified. These measures should effectively reduce the risk of injury or harm. For example, if you identify 'slips and trips' as a hazard, your control measures might include ensuring non-slip mats are in place and that spills are cleaned up immediately.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchens can use the same control measures.**

Each kitchen is unique, so control measures should be tailored to specific hazards and situations in your kitchen. What works for one might not be suitable for another.

**Common misunderstanding: Once set, control measures do not need to be updated.**

Control measures should be reviewed and updated regularly or when changes in the kitchen occur, such as new equipment or changes in staff, to ensure they remain effective.

## Whatâ€™s the difference between existing and additional controls?

Existing controls are measures already in place to manage risks, like daily cleaning routines to prevent slips. Additional controls are new measures you decide to implement after assessing that the existing ones are insufficient. For instance, if after evaluation, daily cleaning is found inadequate during peak hours, an additional control could be to increase cleaning frequency during these times.

**Common misunderstanding: Additional controls are always more expensive or complex.**

Not necessarily. Sometimes, additional controls can be simple adjustments to existing practices, such as changing the timing of certain tasks.

**Common misunderstanding: If no accidents have occurred, existing controls are adequate.**

Lack of incidents doesn't always mean that controls are effective. Regular reviews and proactive updates are crucial to maintain safety.

## How detailed do control measures need to be?

Control measures should be detailed enough to clearly explain how risks are managed so that they can be consistently applied by all staff. They should include specific actions, responsible persons, and timing (e.g., "Kitchen staff must wear cut-resistant gloves when handling knives, to be enforced by the Head Chef during all shifts").

**Common misunderstanding: A brief note on control measures is sufficient for compliance.**

While brevity may be tempting, insufficient detail can lead to inconsistent application and misunderstandings, reducing the effectiveness of your risk management.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed control measures make the assessment too complicated to follow.**

Detail is necessary for clarity, but it can be presented in a straightforward, easy-to-follow format. Using clear headings, bullet points, and straightforward language can help.
