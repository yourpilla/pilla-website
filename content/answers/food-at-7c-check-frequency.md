# If food in the fridge is at 7°C, how often should we check it?

When food temperature is between 6-8°C, you need to monitor it hourly to ensure it doesn't exceed 8°C. This is because 8°C is the critical limit - if food goes above this temperature, you'll need to take immediate corrective action.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the fridge is set to the correct temperature, food inside will remain safe without frequent checks.**

While setting the fridge to the correct temperature is crucial, it does not guarantee that the food inside will maintain the same temperature. Variations can occur due to factors like frequent opening of the fridge or overloading it, which can cause the internal temperature to rise. Hourly checks are essential to ensure the safety of the food.

If the temperature continues to rise and goes above 8°C, you'll need to transfer the food to another refrigeration unit. If you don't have access to another unit, you must use the food within 4 hours of it being exposed to temperatures above 8°C. Any food that's been above 8°C for longer than 4 hours must be thrown away.

**Common misunderstanding: If the food temperature rises above 8°C but the food still feels cold, it is safe to keep it for longer than 4 hours.**

Feeling cold to the touch does not mean the food is safe. Bacteria can grow rapidly at temperatures above 8°C, even if the food feels cold. It is critical to adhere to the 4-hour rule to prevent food-borne illnesses.

## Should we be recording these hourly checks somewhere?

Yes, it's crucial to document all temperature checks and actions taken in Pilla. Add detailed comments about the temperature readings and any corrective measures you've implemented as comments on your fridge temperature checks. This documentation creates an important audit trail that may need to be shown to health inspectors in the future.

**Common misunderstanding: Electronic documentation isn't necessary as long as manual logs are kept.**

While manual logs are better than no records, electronic documentation offers superior advantages such as ease of access, reduced risk of data loss, and the ability to quickly share information with health inspectors. Systems like Pilla also provide automated reminders and alerts, ensuring compliance and consistent monitoring.
