When writing FOH cleaning tasks, it's key to be specific and clear so every team member knows exactly what to do. Use actionable language that leaves no room for interpretation. For example, instead of saying "Clean the bar," specify "Wipe down the bar surface and stools with disinfectant after each shift."

**Common misunderstanding: More details make instructions confusing.**

Actually, more detailed instructions prevent confusion. They ensure that everyone understands the tasks the same way, which leads to consistent cleaning standards.

**Common misunderstanding: It's enough to just list what needs to be cleaned.**

Listing what needs to be cleaned is a start, but how to clean it and how often it should be cleaned are equally important. Clear instructions help maintain high standards and ensure tasks are completed properly.

## What's the best format to structure each task in a FOH cleaning checklist?

Each task in your FOH cleaning checklist should be structured to include specific details: what to clean, where it is, how to clean it, how often, and who is responsible. This format ensures that tasks are done efficiently and effectively. For example, "Sanitise table tops and chair backs at the main dining area using a food-safe cleaner after each guest leaves, to be completed by the server assigned to that section."

**Common misunderstanding: A simple task list is enough for effective cleaning.**

A simple list might seem easier, but without detailed instructions, staff may not clean to the standards you expect. Structuring tasks with clear details ensures consistency and thoroughness.

**Common misunderstanding: Assigning tasks to specific roles is unnecessary.**

Assigning tasks to specific roles not only clarifies responsibility but also ensures accountability. This helps in maintaining a clean and welcoming environment for guests.

## Which vague phrases should I avoid when writing FOH cleaning instructions?

Avoid vague phrases like "tidy up," "make sure," and "clean well." These do not provide clear guidance on what exactly needs to be done. Instead, use specific and direct language such as "wipe," "sanitise," "sweep," and "replace." For instance, instead of saying "Ensure the menus are clean," specify "Wipe down menus with a sanitising solution after each use and check for wear or damage."

**Common misunderstanding: Vague language gives staff flexibility to use their judgement.**

While flexibility is important, cleaning tasks require specific standards to meet health and safety regulations. Clear instructions ensure these standards are met consistently.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed instructions are only necessary for new staff.**

Even experienced staff benefit from detailed instructions to avoid complacency and ensure all areas meet the same high standards. This maintains your restaurant's reputation for cleanliness and safety.
