# What daily checks should I carry out on my coffee machine?

Every day, it's important to carry out specific checks to ensure your coffee machine is safe and functioning properly. Start by inspecting the machine for any visible damage or leaks. Check that all controls and emergency stop functions are clearly marked and fully operational. Ensure the steam wand, water nozzles, and filters are clean and clear of obstructions. Finally, verify that the pressure gauge is within safe operating limits.

**Common misunderstanding: If the machine turns on, it must be working fine.**

Just because a coffee machine powers up doesn't mean all its functions are working safely or correctly. Daily checks should include specific safety and performance tests, not just powering the machine on.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick visual inspection is enough for daily checks.**

While a visual check is a good start, it’s important to test the functionality of the machine, including safety controls and emergency features, to ensure everything is operating as it should.

## How do I check that staff are using the coffee machine safely?

To ensure staff are using the coffee machine safely, observe their operation during peak times and spot-check their adherence to training. Make sure they use all safety features, such as the steam wand correctly, and follow all operational procedures. Regularly remind and retrain staff on the correct use of the machine, especially if you notice any unsafe practices.

**Common misunderstanding: Experienced staff don’t need to be monitored.**

Even the most experienced employees can develop unsafe habits or overlook procedures, especially during busy periods. Regular checks help maintain high safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: If no accidents have occurred, then safety practices must be adequate.**

Lack of accidents doesn't necessarily mean that safety practices are being followed; it could be due to luck. Proactive monitoring and enforcement of safety rules are crucial.

## Should I use a checklist for daily coffee machine safety checks?

Yes, using a checklist for daily safety checks on your coffee machine is highly recommended. It ensures consistency in checking all necessary components and safety features. The checklist should include items such as checking for leaks, ensuring the machine is clean, verifying that emergency stops are functional, and making sure the pressure gauge reads within safe limits.

**Common misunderstanding: Checklists are only for less experienced staff.**

Checklists benefit all staff members by providing a clear, step-by-step guide to follow, which helps prevent steps from being overlooked, regardless of experience level.

**Common misunderstanding: A checklist makes the checking process longer and more cumbersome.**

While it might take a bit more time, using a checklist can actually streamline the process by clearly outlining what needs to be checked, ultimately saving time by avoiding potential machine downtime due to unresolved issues.
