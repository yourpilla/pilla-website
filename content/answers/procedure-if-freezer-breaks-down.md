# What's the procedure if the freezer breaks down?

If your freezer breaks down, here's what you need to do

1.  First, check if the food is still frozen solid. If it is, quickly transfer it to another freezer.
2.  If food has started to defrost but isn't fully thawed, move it to a fridge for controlled defrosting and use within 48 hours.
3.  Any fully defrosted items must be discarded - never refreeze defrosted food.
4.  Use the Pilla app to highlight the freezer breakdown as an issue and tag relevant colleagues
5.  Document all your actions as comments on the freezer temperature check in the app for future inspection records.

**Common misunderstanding: A freezer breakdown can be ignored if the temperature inside the freezer is still low.**

Even if the temperature appears low, a breakdown might lead to gradual warming, which can affect food safety. Always address the issue promptly to ensure food remains at a safe temperature and prevent spoilage.

**Common misunderstanding: If the freezer breaks down, you can refreeze items that have started to defrost as long as they still feel cold.**

Refreezing defrosted items is unsafe, even if they feel cold. Once food begins to defrost, bacteria can start to multiply. Refreezing can compromise food quality and safety. It's crucial to follow the proper procedure and discard fully defrosted items.

## What about ice cream and other items that must stay frozen?

Items like ice cream that must remain frozen at all times need to either be used immediately or discarded if they've started to defrost. These products cannot be safely refrozen under any circumstances.

**Common misunderstanding: Ice cream and similar items can be safely consumed if they have thawed but refrozen quickly.**

This is false. Once ice cream starts to thaw, its texture and safety are compromised due to potential bacterial growth. Refreezing affects both quality and safety, making it essential to consume or discard thawed ice cream promptly.

**Common misunderstanding: Only temperature-sensitive items like ice cream require immediate attention during a freezer breakdown.**

While items like ice cream are highly sensitive, all frozen foods can be affected by temperature changes. Prompt action is necessary for all items to ensure food safety and prevent spoilage.

## How do I prevent cross-contamination during a freezer breakdown?

Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods during the transfer process. If their juices have leaked onto other items during defrosting, those affected items must be discarded. When in doubt about potential cross-contamination, it's always safer to dispose of the food rather than risk foodborne illness.

**Common misunderstanding:: If the freezer is clean, cross-contamination is not a concern during a breakdown.**

Cross-contamination can occur regardless of cleanliness if raw juices from meat or poultry come into contact with other foods during defrosting. Always maintain separation to mitigate this risk.

**Common misunderstanding: Cross-contamination only occurs with raw meat and poultry.**

While raw meat and poultry are common culprits, cross-contamination can also involve other foods or allergens. It is vital to handle all foods with care during a breakdown to prevent any type of contamination.
