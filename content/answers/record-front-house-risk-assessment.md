Recording your front of house (FOH) risk assessment accurately is crucial for ensuring safety and compliance. You can choose between a table style layout or a written listicle style document. Both formats help you organise information about hazards, who might be harmed, existing controls, and additional actions needed.

**Common misunderstanding: A simple checklist is enough for a risk assessment.**

A checklist might miss specific details about how hazards affect different staff or customers. A detailed record that includes who could be harmed and how, along with control measures, is essential for a thorough assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: Once recorded, no updates are needed unless a major change occurs.**

Risk assessments should be reviewed annually or sooner if changes occur in the FOH environment, such as new equipment or changes in staff roles, to ensure all information is current and effective.

## What is the best format for a front of house risk assessment document?

The best format for your FOH risk assessment document depends on your preference for detail and clarity. The table style layout is traditional and organises information into columns, which is great for quick reference. The listicle style, used in the Pilla template, provides more space for detailed descriptions and is beneficial for complex environments with numerous hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: More detailed documents are always better.**

While detail is important, the key is clarity and usability. The document should be easy to understand and act upon by anyone reading it, not just safety experts.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital records are not as valid as paper records.**

Digital and paper records are equally valid, but digital versions can be easier to update and share across your team, ensuring everyone has access to the latest safety information.

## How does the Pilla FOH risk assessment template help with recording hazards?

The Pilla FOH risk assessment template is designed to streamline the process of identifying and documenting hazards in the front of house area. It guides you to describe each hazard, identify who could be harmed and how, list current control measures, and suggest additional controls. This structured approach helps ensure no critical elements are overlooked.

**Common misunderstanding: The template covers all possible hazards.**

While the template provides a comprehensive framework, it's important to tailor it to your specific setting. Hazards can vary greatly depending on layout, customer behaviour, and other local factors.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a template means you donâ€™t need to understand the risks fully.**

Even with a template, the person completing the assessment needs a good understanding of the FOH operations and potential risks. The template is a tool to aid recording, not a substitute for a safety-conscious management approach.
