Cleaning high-risk equipment like slicers, mixers, and dishwashers is crucial to prevent food contamination. Always use the right cleaning agents and follow a thorough cleaning process. Start by removing any food debris, then wash with a suitable detergent, rinse, and finally sanitise using an appropriate sanitiser.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick wipe down is enough for high-risk equipment.**

A simple wipe down does not remove all bacteria or food particles. High-risk equipment needs a detailed cleaning process to ensure all harmful microorganisms are eliminated.

**Common misunderstanding: Using any kind of soap is fine for cleaning these types of equipment.**

Not all cleaning agents are safe or effective for food equipment. Use only detergents and sanitisers that are approved for use on food contact surfaces to avoid chemical contamination.

## What’s the right way to clean dishwashers and glasswashers?

To clean dishwashers and glasswashers effectively, empty the machine of any dishes or glasses first. Check and clean the filters to remove any trapped debris. Run a cleaning cycle using a specialised dishwasher cleaner to remove grease and limescale. Regularly inspect and clean the spray arms and door seals to prevent buildup.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to leave food residue in the machine because the next cycle will clean it.**

Leaving food residue can lead to clogs and inefficiency. It's important to clean out food particles before running a wash cycle to maintain optimal performance and hygiene.

**Common misunderstanding: Regular soap can be used in place of specialised dishwasher cleaners.**

Using regular soap can cause problems with your machine and doesn't effectively remove grease or limescale. Always use cleaners specifically designed for dishwashers and glasswashers.

## How should slicers and mixers be cleaned to avoid contamination?

For slicers and mixers, first unplug the equipment and disassemble any removable parts. Soak these parts in hot soapy water, scrub them clean, rinse, and then sanitise. Wipe down the non-removable parts with a damp cloth soaked in detergent, followed by sanitiser. Allow all parts to air dry before reassembling.

**Common misunderstanding: Sanitising is not necessary if you’ve already washed with soap.**

Washing removes visible dirt and grease, but sanitising is essential to kill any remaining bacteria. Always sanitise after washing to ensure the equipment is safe for food contact.

**Common misunderstanding: Air drying is not important after cleaning.**

Air drying is a hygienic method to dry equipment because it prevents the spread of bacteria from towels. Always allow equipment to air dry completely before reassembling or using it again.

## What steps should be included in cleaning chilling and hot-holding equipment?

Cleaning chilling and hot-holding equipment involves several steps: turn off and unplug the equipment, remove any food and debris, clean all surfaces with a suitable detergent, rinse, then apply a food-safe sanitiser. Pay special attention to handles and control panels where germs are likely to accumulate.

**Common misunderstanding: You can clean these machines while they are still hot or running.**

Always turn off and cool down equipment before cleaning to prevent injury and ensure effective cleaning.

**Common misunderstanding: Occasional cleaning is sufficient for chilling and hot-holding equipment.**

Frequent cleaning is necessary to prevent bacterial growth and maintain food safety. Schedule regular cleanings depending on the usage frequency of the equipment.
