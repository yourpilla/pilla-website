When hiring a Barback, it's crucial to require skills that are fundamental for daily operations. These include organisational and multitasking abilities, physical stamina for lifting and moving supplies, attention to cleanliness and detail, basic knowledge of bar equipment, and strong teamwork and communication skills. These skills ensure that the Barback can effectively support the bartenders and maintain the bar's efficiency and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: All barbacks need extensive experience with cocktails and spirits.**

While some understanding of the bar environment is beneficial, extensive knowledge of cocktails and spirits isn't an essential skill for all barbacks. Focus on core operational skills that support the smooth running of the bar.

**Common misunderstanding: Advanced customer service skills are a must for barbacks.**

Good communication is important, but barbacks typically support bartenders rather than interact extensively with customers. The primary focus should be on efficiency and support within the bar team.

## What nice-to-have skills add value without being mandatory?

Nice-to-have skills for a Barback can enhance their role but aren't critical for job performance. These include a basic understanding of cocktail ingredients, previous experience in high-demand bar settings, and a willingness to learn more about drink preparation and bar science. These skills can help a Barback transition into more complex roles over time, such as bartending, and contribute to a more knowledgeable and versatile team.

**Common misunderstanding: Nice-to-have skills are unnecessary for the job.**

While not essential, nice-to-have skills can significantly improve a Barback's effectiveness and provide them with growth opportunities within the bar. They add depth to the team's skill set and can improve service quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Nice-to-have skills should be treated as requirements.**

Treating these skills as requirements can limit your applicant pool. Recognise them as beneficial extras that can enhance a candidate's fit but are not critical for the basic functions of the job.

## How do we avoid over-specifying skills and turning away good candidates?

To avoid over-specifying skills, focus on the essentials needed to perform the job effectively and be open to training candidates who demonstrate potential but may lack certain skills. Clearly differentiate between essential and desirable skills in your job descriptions to encourage a broader range of applicants. This approach helps you attract candidates who are a good fit for your bar's culture and operational needs, without being unnecessarily restrictive.

**Common misunderstanding: More detailed skill requirements lead to better candidates.**

Overly detailed or stringent skill requirements can deter potentially great candidates who might feel they don't qualify. Keep requirements realistic and focused on what's truly necessary for the role.

**Common misunderstanding: Any flexibility in skill requirements will lower the quality of staff.**

Flexibility in non-essential skills can actually broaden your talent pool and bring in diverse candidates who can grow into their roles with the right training and support. This can lead to a more dynamic and adaptable team.
