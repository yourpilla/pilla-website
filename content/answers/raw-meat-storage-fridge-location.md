# Where exactly should raw meat be stored in the fridge

Raw meat should always be stored on the lowest shelf of the fridge. This is crucial to prevent any drips from contaminating other foods stored below. Ideally, raw meat should be kept in a separate fridge from ready-to-eat foods, but if this isn't possible, keeping it on the bottom shelf is essential.

Make sure to store the raw meat in a container or tray that can catch any drips to prevent contamination of the fridge itself.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to store raw meat on any shelf as long as it's wrapped tightly.**

While wrapping raw meat tightly is important to prevent direct contamination, storing it on the lowest shelf remains crucial. This is because juices from raw meat can still escape from even tightly wrapped packages and contaminate other foods below if they are not positioned correctly.

**Common misunderstanding: Refrigeration completely stops bacterial growth on raw meat.**

Refrigeration only slows down bacterial growth but does not stop it entirely. Raw meat should be consumed or processed in a timely manner, typically within 1-2 days for ground meats and 3-5 days for larger cuts to ensure safety and freshness.

## What about when I'm defrosting raw meat in the fridge?

When defrosting raw meat in the fridge, you must always place it in an outer tray or container to catch any drips. This prevents contamination of both the fridge and other products. Remember that once defrosted, the meat must be used within 24 hours.

**Common misunderstanding: You can refreeze meat safely after defrosting it in the fridge.**

While it's technically possible to refreeze meat that was defrosted in the fridge, it is not recommended due to potential quality degradation. Additionally, repeated freezing and thawing can increase the risk of bacterial growth if not handled properly.

**Common misunderstanding: Defrosting meat at room temperature is as safe as defrosting it in the fridge.**

Defrosting meat at room temperature is unsafe as it allows the outer layers to warm above the safe temperature zone, encouraging bacterial growth, while the inside remains frozen. Always defrost meat in the fridge where it stays at a safe, consistent temperature.

## Should I cover the raw meat when storing it?

Yes, all foods in the fridge, including raw meat, must be adequately covered to prevent physical, allergenic and microbiological contamination. Only use food-grade storage containers or food-grade wrapping materials - never use tea towels or cloths to cover food in the fridge.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to cover raw meat with any type of cloth or towel in the fridge.**

Using cloths or towels to cover raw meat is unsafe as they can harbour bacteria and are not impermeable, which can lead to cross-contamination. Always use food-grade containers or wraps designed specifically to contain raw meat safely.

**Common misunderstanding: Covering raw meat is only necessary to prevent odours from spreading in the fridge.**

While covering raw meat can help manage odours, its primary purpose is to prevent contamination. Proper coverings protect against physical debris, allergens, and microorganisms, thus ensuring food safety and quality.
