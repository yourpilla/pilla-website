# What supporting systems should be included in a food safety policy?

In any food-related business, a food safety policy should include systems like cleaning schedules, pest control measures, and supplier checks. These systems help manage risks and ensure that the food served is safe to eat. Not having these systems in place can lead to health hazards and legal issues.

**Common misunderstanding: A food safety policy only needs to focus on food handling and preparation.**

While food handling and preparation are crucial, other supporting systems like cleaning and pest control are equally important. They prevent contamination and ensure a safe environment for food preparation.

**Common misunderstanding: Once set, the food safety policy doesnâ€™t need regular updates.**

A food safety policy needs regular reviews and updates to adapt to new health guidelines or changes in operations. Staying current is key to maintaining effective food safety standards.

## Why are cleaning, pest control and supplier checks important to mention?

Cleaning, pest control, and supplier checks are critical components of a comprehensive food safety policy. Regular cleaning prevents bacterial growth and cross-contamination. Effective pest control ensures that the premises are free from organisms that could contaminate food. Supplier checks guarantee that all ingredients meet safety standards before they enter your kitchen.

**Common misunderstanding: Pest control is a concern only for storage areas.**

Pests can affect all areas of a food service establishment, not just storage. Regular pest control is necessary throughout the premises to maintain a hygienic environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Supplier checks are only necessary for new suppliers.**

Regular checks should be done for all suppliers, not just new ones, to ensure consistent quality and safety of all ingredients used in your business.

## How do supporting systems relate to your HACCP plan?

Supporting systems like cleaning, pest control, and supplier checks are integral to a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan. They help identify potential hazards and establish procedures to control risks at various stages of food production and handling. Without these systems, critical control points identified in your HACCP plan might not be effectively managed.

**Common misunderstanding: HACCP is only about controlling the cooking process.**

HACCP covers all stages of food production, from procurement to service. Supporting systems ensure hazards are controlled at every step, not just cooking.

**Common misunderstanding: If you have a HACCP plan, other supporting systems are less important.**

Even with a HACCP plan, supporting systems are essential. They work together to ensure a comprehensive approach to food safety, covering all aspects of your operation.
