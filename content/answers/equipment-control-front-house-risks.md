# What equipment helps control front of house risks in hospitality?

Choosing the right equipment is key to managing risks in the front of house areas of hospitality settings. Equipment like sturdy trays, lighter glassware, slip-resistant shoes, and drop-proof POS stands can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents and injuries.

**Common misunderstanding: More equipment always means better safety.**

It's not just about having more equipment but choosing the right tools that specifically address the risks identified in your risk assessment. For example, using sturdier trays can help prevent food and drinks from being dropped, but won't necessarily help with slip hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: High-tech equipment is required to improve safety.**

While technology can enhance safety, many effective solutions are straightforward and do not rely on high technology. For instance, simple changes like slip-resistant mats or better lighting can be highly effective in reducing risks.

## Should I invest in slip-resistant gear for front of house staff?

Yes, investing in slip-resistant gear for front of house staff is a wise decision. This includes items like slip-resistant shoes, which can greatly reduce the risk of slips and falls, particularly in areas prone to spills or wet floors.

**Common misunderstanding: Slip-resistant shoes are only needed in the kitchen.**

While kitchens are high-risk areas for slips, front of house areas also experience spillages and wet floors, especially near bar areas or entrances. Therefore, slip-resistant shoes are just as important for front of house staff.

**Common misunderstanding: All slip-resistant shoes provide the same level of protection.**

Different shoes have different levels of slip resistance. It's important to choose footwear that meets industry safety standards for the best protection.

## What equipment upgrades reduce hazards in FOH service areas?

Upgrading equipment in FOH service areas can significantly reduce hazards. Consider using lighter glassware to reduce the risk of breakages and injuries, sturdier trays to prevent spills, and well-designed furniture to avoid clutter and ensure clear pathways.

**Common misunderstanding: Upgrading equipment is too costly and not worth the investment.**

While there may be upfront costs, investing in safer, more efficient equipment can reduce accidents, improve staff morale, and decrease long-term costs associated with injuries and damaged goods.

**Common misunderstanding: New equipment will automatically fit into the existing workflow.**

When introducing new equipment, it's crucial to consider how it integrates into your current operations. Training and adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the new tools effectively reduce risks without disrupting service.
