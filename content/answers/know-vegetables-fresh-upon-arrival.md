When checking vegetables on delivery, there are several key indicators of freshness to look for:

-   They should be firm when touched, not spongy or limp
-   Look for any signs of mold - there should be none
-   They should have a fresh smell
-   Check for any blemishes, bruising or discolouration
-   Make sure there's no dirt, stones or signs of insect activity around or in the produce

**Common misunderstanding: If vegetables are visually perfect, they must be fresh.**

Visual perfection does not necessarily equate to freshness. While visual inspection is important, it should be combined with other indicators such as texture, smell, and the absence of mold. Some vegetables might look perfect but could have been treated with chemicals to enhance appearance, which doesn't guarantee freshness.

**Common misunderstanding: All fresh vegetables have a vivid green color.**

Not all fresh vegetables are vividly green. The colour of vegetables depends on their type and variety. For instance, carrots and beets should not be green but have their natural, vibrant colours. It's essential to know the expected colour for each type of vegetable to accurately assess freshness.

## What if I notice some vegetables aren't fresh when they arrive?

If you notice any vegetables that don't meet these freshness standards, you should reject them immediately and contact your supplier. Make sure to clearly label any rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them separately so they don't risk contaminating other products while waiting for return to the supplier.

**Common misunderstanding: You can always salvage non-fresh vegetables by washing or cooking them.**

While washing or cooking might remove surface dirt or bacteria, it cannot reverse spoilage or restore freshness to vegetables. Using non-fresh vegetables can compromise the quality and safety of your dishes, so it's crucial to reject any that do not meet freshness standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Non-fresh vegetables should just be thrown away immediately.**

Instead of discarding non-fresh vegetables immediately, it's advisable to contact your supplier for a possible return or refund. Properly label and segregate them to prevent contamination of other produce, and follow your supplier's guidelines for handling returns.

## How quickly do I need to get the vegetables into storage after delivery?

You should aim to transfer all delivered goods from the delivery point to their proper storage areas within 15 minutes of arrival, including unpacking time. In exceptional circumstances, you can take up to 30 minutes maximum. However, remember that chilled items should always be prioritised first, then frozen goods, and finally ambient items like vegetables. Make sure to unpack everything in a designated area to avoid any contamination risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Vegetables can be left out at room temperature for hours without issue.**

Leaving vegetables at room temperature for extended periods can lead to quality deterioration and increase the risk of bacterial growth. It is crucial to transfer them to appropriate storage quickly, ideally within 15 minutes, to maintain their freshness and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: All types of produce can be stored together in the same conditions.**

Different types of produce have varying storage requirements. For instance, some vegetables emit ethylene gas, which can speed up the ripening and spoilage of other produce. Storing them separately and in the right conditions helps maintain their quality and prolongs shelf life.
