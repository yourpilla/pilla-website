  Ideally, fresh fish should be stored in a separate fridge set at a temperature
  below 3°C to meet its specific cooling requirements.
---
Ideally, yes. Since fresh fish requires a lower temperature than other items, it's best to have a dedicated fridge set at the correct temperature. If you must store fish in the same fridge as other items, make sure it's on the lowest shelf to prevent drip contamination, and ensure the fridge can maintain the required temperature below 3°C.

**Common misunderstanding: You can store fresh fish in any part of a fridge as long as the overall temperature is set correctly.**

Even if the fridge is set to the right overall temperature, storing fish on the top shelf can lead to drip contamination. Fresh fish should always be stored on the lowest shelf to avoid contaminating other foods with any potential drips.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a standard refrigerator thermometer is sufficient for monitoring fish storage temperature.**

While a standard thermometer can provide a general sense of the fridge's temperature, fresh fish requires a more precise monitoring system to ensure it remains below 3°C. A calibrated, high-precision thermometer is recommended to maintain the temperature requirements for fish storage.

## What's the difference between fridge storage temperature for regular items and fresh fish?

Regular items need to be stored below 5°C as a target temperature, with 8°C being the absolute maximum limit. However, fresh fish has stricter requirements - it must be stored below 3°C at all times. If fresh fish is found above 3°C, it needs to be discarded immediately.

**Common misunderstanding: If fresh fish is slightly above 3°C for a short period, it is still safe to consume.**

Fresh fish must always be stored below 3°C. Any exposure above this temperature, even for a short duration, can increase the risk of bacterial growth and spoilage, making the fish unsafe to consume.

**Common misunderstanding: All types of seafood have the same temperature storage requirements as fresh fish.**

Not all seafood requires the same storage conditions as fresh fish. Shellfish and certain other seafood items may have different storage requirements. It's important to understand the specific needs of each seafood type to ensure safety and quality.

## What happens if my fridge temperature goes above these limits?

For regular items, if the temperature rises above 5°C, you should recheck in an hour. If food reaches above 8°C, you have a 4-hour window to either use it or move it to another fridge. After 4 hours above 8°C, the food must be thrown away. However, with fresh fish, there's no flexibility - if it goes above 3°C at any point, it must be discarded right away.

**Common misunderstanding:: If the power goes out, the fridge will maintain its temperature for several hours without issue.**

While modern fridges can maintain temperatures for a short time during a power outage, the internal temperature can rise quickly, especially if the door is opened. It's crucial to monitor the temperature closely and have a contingency plan to move sensitive items like fresh fish to an alternative cooling source.

**Common misunderstanding: If food is moved quickly to another fridge, it can be safely consumed even if it was above the safe temperature for a while.**

For regular items, there is some flexibility within a 4-hour window if the temperature is above 8°C. However, for fresh fish, any exposure above 3°C compromises safety, and it should be discarded immediately to prevent food-borne illnesses.
