# What kind of service style information should I include in a Sous Chef job description?

When writing a job description for a Sous Chef, it's important to clearly describe the service style of your restaurant. This helps potential candidates understand the pace and environment they will be working in. For example, specify if your restaurant offers a fine dining experience, a fast-paced bistro setting, or a casual dining atmosphere. This information sets clear expectations and attracts candidates who are comfortable and thrive in your specific service style.

**Common misunderstanding: Any experienced Sous Chef should adapt to any service style.**

While adaptability is a valuable trait, specific service styles require particular skills and temperaments. For instance, fine dining often demands meticulous attention to detail and presentation, whereas a high-volume bistro might prioritize speed and efficiency. Clearly communicating the service style helps in finding a Sous Chef who is not only skilled but also a good fit for the pace and nature of your kitchen.

**Common misunderstanding: Describing the service style is not as important as listing the duties.**

The service style directly impacts how duties are performed in the kitchen. It influences the working pace, stress levels, and even the customer interaction. Therefore, including this in your job description is crucial for setting the right expectations and ensuring the candidate knows what will be expected of them.

## How do I communicate the type of cuisine my restaurant specialises in when crafting a Sous Chef job description?

Clearly stating the type of cuisine your restaurant specialises in is crucial in a Sous Chef job description. This not only helps in attracting candidates who are passionate about or experienced in that particular culinary style but also sets the stage for the menu they will be working with. For example, mention if your restaurant focuses on modern European cuisine, traditional Asian dishes, or fusion cooking. This detail helps potential Sous Chefs assess their fit and excitement for the role based on their culinary expertise and interests.

**Common misunderstanding: Broad cuisine categories are sufficient to attract the right candidates.**

Being specific about your cuisine type avoids confusion and attracts more qualified candidates. For instance, specifying "authentic Neapolitan pizza" rather than just "Italian cuisine" can make a significant difference in attracting someone with the exact expertise you need.

**Common misunderstanding: Candidates will adapt to any cuisine type.**

While many chefs are adaptable, they may excel in specific cuisines due to their training and experience. A candidate passionate about and experienced in your specific type of cuisine will likely perform better and contribute more creatively to your menu.

## What information about the flow between kitchen and front-of-house is crucial in a Sous Chef job description?

In your Sous Chef job description, it's important to describe how the kitchen interacts with the front-of-house. This includes how communication is handled during service, how orders are processed, and how any issues are resolved. For example, you might specify if the Sous Chef is expected to directly coordinate with the service manager, or if they should handle customer special requests personally. This information helps candidates understand the scope of their responsibilities and the teamwork required.

**Common misunderstanding: The kitchen and front-of-house operate independently.**

In most restaurant settings, the interaction between kitchen and front-of-house is crucial for smooth operation. A Sous Chef often plays a key role in this interaction, so candidates need to be aware of these expectations.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed descriptions of kitchen-front house flow are unnecessary in the job description.**

Providing details on this flow helps potential Sous Chefs understand the dynamics of the role beyond just cooking and managing the kitchen. It highlights the importance of communication skills and the ability to manage a team that extends beyond the kitchen.
