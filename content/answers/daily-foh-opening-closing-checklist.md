Starting and ending the day with a clean front of house (FOH) is crucial for maintaining a welcoming environment. Your daily FOH cleaning checklist should cover all areas that impact guest perception and hygiene. Here’s what you need to include:

-   Wipe down the host stand, reset menus, and ensure all POS equipment is clean.
-   Polish door glass and handles to remove fingerprints and smudges.
-   Check and clean toilets, ensuring they are stocked with soap and paper.
-   Restock napkins, condiments, and tabletop items.
-   Vacuum or mop key walkways and under tables.
-   Empty bins, replace liners, and clean bin lids.
-   Spot clean walls, door frames, and baseboards.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick tidy-up is enough for opening and closing.**

Simply tidying up isn't sufficient. A thorough clean, following a detailed checklist, ensures that every area meets high standards of cleanliness and readiness for guests.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning once per day is enough.**

Cleaning both at opening and closing is essential. This not only maintains standards throughout the day but also prepares your space for the next business day, ensuring a consistently clean environment.

## Why is it essential to clean toilets at the start and end of every shift?

Cleaning toilets at both the start and end of every shift is vital for maintaining hygiene and guest comfort. Toilets are high-traffic areas and can quickly become unsanitary. Regular cleaning prevents the buildup of germs and ensures a pleasant experience for every guest.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning toilets once a day is sufficient.**

Given the frequency of use and the potential for quick contamination, toilets need attention multiple times a day to maintain the necessary hygiene standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Guests don’t notice the cleanliness of toilets as much as other areas.**

Guests often judge the cleanliness of the entire venue based on the state of the toilets. A clean toilet area significantly impacts their overall impression and trust in your hygiene practices.

## How can daily FOH cleaning tasks improve guest confidence?

Daily cleaning tasks in the FOH area are critical for making a good first impression. When guests see a clean and well-maintained environment, it builds their confidence in your service and cleanliness, directly impacting their overall experience and satisfaction.

**Common misunderstanding: FOH cleanliness is only about aesthetics.**

While a clean FOH looks good, it also plays a crucial role in hygiene. Regular cleaning reduces the risk of cross-contamination and ensures a safer dining experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Infrequent deep cleaning is enough to maintain standards.**

Daily cleaning tasks are necessary to address the gradual buildup of dirt and wear that occurs with regular use. This maintains high standards consistently, rather than relying on periodic deep cleaning which might leave issues unaddressed in the interim.
