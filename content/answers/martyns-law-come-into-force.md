# When does Martyn's Law come into force?

Martyn's Law, officially known as the Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Act 2025, received Royal Assent on 3rd April 2025. However, the new duties will not apply immediately. The government has set an implementation period, with enforcement expected to begin around 2027. This means that while the law is officially in place, the requirements won't be enforceable until this future date.

**Common misunderstanding: Martyn's Law is effective immediately after it receives Royal Assent.**

This is not the case. Although the law has been passed, there is a planned implementation period before it becomes enforceable. This period is intended to allow businesses adequate time to prepare and comply with the new regulations.

**Common misunderstanding: Businesses can delay preparations for compliance until the law is enforced.**

It's important to start preparations early. The period before enforcement begins is intended for businesses to establish and train their staff on new security measures, not to delay taking action.

## What is the implementation timeline for Martyn’s Law?

The implementation timeline for Martyn's Law spans several years, reflecting the importance of thorough preparation. After receiving Royal Assent in April 2025, there is a 24-month period before the law's requirements become enforceable. This means that by around 2027, businesses must be fully compliant with the law's stipulations. This timeline allows for the establishment of a regulatory framework and provides businesses with time to understand and integrate the new requirements into their operations.

**Common misunderstanding: The implementation timeline is the same for all businesses.**

While the timeline for the law's enforcement is consistent, the specific preparations and adjustments needed may vary significantly depending on the size and type of venue. Larger venues may have more complex requirements and should use this time to conduct detailed risk assessments and develop robust security plans.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the law is in force, businesses can no longer adjust their security measures.**

Security is an ongoing concern, and businesses are encouraged to continuously review and update their measures. The implementation period is just the beginning of a long-term process of maintaining a secure environment.

## Why is there a grace period before enforcement?

The grace period before the enforcement of Martyn's Law is designed to give businesses sufficient time to prepare for the new requirements. This includes registering with the regulator, developing terrorism response plans, and training staff. The period is also used by the government to set up the regulatory framework necessary to support and enforce the law. This approach ensures that all parties involved have the resources and knowledge needed to comply effectively.

**Common misunderstanding: The grace period means that security measures can be postponed.**

While enforcement may not begin immediately, it is crucial for businesses to start their preparations as soon as possible. The grace period is intended for active preparation, not inactivity.

**Common misunderstanding: The grace period will be extended if businesses are not ready.**

There is no indication that the grace period will be extended. Businesses should plan to meet the original deadlines to ensure compliance and avoid potential penalties.
