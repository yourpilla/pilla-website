# Can I leave my food probe thermometer in the fridge overnight?

No, you should never leave your probe thermometer in the fridge overnight or in any extreme temperature environment. This includes fridges, freezers, ovens, or on hobs. Exposure to these conditions can damage the probe's sensitivity and affect its accuracy for future readings.

**Common misunderstanding: Food probe thermometers are designed to withstand all temperature extremes, so storing them in a fridge or freezer won't affect their performance.**

While food probe thermometers are built to take accurate readings at various temperatures, they are not designed to be stored in extreme conditions like a fridge or freezer. Prolonged exposure to such environments can impair the probe's internal sensors and accuracy, leading to unreliable readings in the future. Always store your thermometer at room temperature when not in use.

**Common misunderstanding: Leaving the thermometer in the fridge helps it acclimate, providing more accurate readings for cold foods.**

Acclimating a thermometer to cold environments, such as a fridge, is unnecessary and can be detrimental. Modern food probe thermometers are designed to provide accurate readings without needing to be pre-cooled. Storing them in the fridge can cause sensor damage and calibration issues, leading to inaccurate temperature readings.

## What's the best way to store my probe thermometer then?

The best practice is to keep your probe thermometer in its protective case in a clean, dry place at room temperature. Make sure it's properly cleaned and sanitised before storage, and regularly check the batteries to ensure accurate readings.

**Common misunderstanding: It is safe to store a probe thermometer anywhere in the kitchen, as long as it is cleaned regularly.**

While regular cleaning is essential, storing a probe thermometer in any random spot in the kitchen can expose it to moisture, heat, or contamination. The best practice is to keep it in its protective case in a dry, clean place at room temperature. This ensures the probe remains in optimal condition and prevents damage or inaccuracies.

**Common misunderstanding: You don't need to check the batteries of your probe thermometer unless it stops working.**

Regularly checking the batteries of your probe thermometer is crucial to ensure accurate readings. Low battery levels can result in unreliable temperature measurements. Checking the batteries periodically also prevents unexpected device failure during crucial cooking times.
