# What pre-service responsibilities should I include in a Head Waiter job description?

Pre-service responsibilities are key for a Head Waiter to ensure smooth operations once guests arrive. These include overseeing the setup of the dining area, confirming reservation details, and coordinating with the kitchen to review the menu and special requests. A Head Waiter also needs to ensure all staff are briefed and ready for service.

**Common misunderstanding: Pre-service tasks are just about physical setup.**

While setting up the dining area is important, pre-service also involves strategic planning like staff briefings and reviewing guest reservations to personalise service, which are crucial for exceptional guest experiences.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking in with the kitchen is not necessary before service starts.**

Communication with the kitchen is essential to confirm menu items, discuss any potential issues with ingredients, and understand the timing for dishes. This ensures the front of house and kitchen are aligned, which helps in delivering seamless service.

## How do I describe communication responsibilities between the kitchen and floor staff?

Effective communication between the kitchen and floor staff is vital. In the job description, highlight the Head Waiter's role in facilitating clear and continuous communication. This includes relaying guest feedback to the kitchen, updating the floor staff about wait times or menu changes, and resolving any immediate issues that arise during service.

**Common misunderstanding: Communication is only needed when problems occur.**

Proactive communication is key, not just reactive. Regular updates and check-ins can prevent many service issues and enhance the dining experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital tools replace the need for face-to-face communication.**

While digital tools help in maintaining records and sending quick updates, face-to-face interactions are crucial for immediate problem-solving and maintaining a personal touch in the fast-paced environment of a restaurant.

## What team briefing duties should be mentioned for a Head Waiter role?

Team briefing is a critical duty for a Head Waiter. Mention responsibilities such as conducting pre-shift meetings to discuss the menu, special guest needs, reservations, and any specific service focus areas. It's also important to motivate the team and set the tone for the service period.

**Common misunderstanding: Briefings are just for passing information.**

Beyond information sharing, briefings are crucial for team building, clarifying roles, and motivating staff, which directly impacts service quality.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick briefing at the start of the shift is enough.**
