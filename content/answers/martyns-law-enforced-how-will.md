# How will Martyn's Law be enforced?

Once Martyn's Law is in force, the UK Security Industry Authority (SIA) will oversee its enforcement. This includes monitoring compliance and taking necessary actions to ensure that venues meet the law's requirements. The SIA's role is to support and guide businesses initially, helping them understand and meet their obligations under the law.

**Common misunderstanding: Enforcement will be harsh and immediate.**

Actually, the SIA aims to support and guide businesses first, focusing on helping venues comply rather than punishing them immediately. The initial approach is educational, giving venues time to adjust and meet the requirements.

**Common misunderstanding: Small venues will face the same enforcement as large venues.**

Enforcement will be proportional to the size and risk associated with the venue. Smaller venues with lower risk will not be held to the same stringent standards as larger, higher-risk venues.

## What powers does the SIA regulator have to inspect venues?

The SIA has the authority to inspect venues to ensure compliance with Martyn's Law. Inspectors can visit any venue that falls under the law's scope to review security plans, inspect physical security measures, and interview staff about their training and knowledge of the venue's emergency procedures. These inspections can be scheduled or occur unannounced, depending on the circumstances.

**Common misunderstanding: Inspections will always be unannounced and disruptive.**

While the SIA can conduct unannounced inspections, their main goal is to ensure venues are safe, not to disrupt business. Most inspections are likely to be planned in advance, allowing venues to prepare.

**Common misunderstanding: The SIA will focus only on physical security measures during inspections.**

Inspections will cover all aspects of compliance, not just physical security. This includes reviewing emergency plans, staff training records, and how well staff understand and can execute the venue's response plans.

## What penalties can be imposed for non-compliance?

For venues that fail to comply with Martyn's Law, the SIA can issue various penalties. These range from compliance notices, which require venues to address specific issues by a set deadline, to monetary penalties for more serious or repeated failures. In extreme cases, restriction or closure notices may be issued, and criminal charges could be brought against those who willfully ignore the law.

**Common misunderstanding: All penalties are financial.**

While monetary penalties are part of the enforcement toolkit, the SIA also uses compliance and improvement notices to help venues correct their course without financial punishment, focusing on achieving compliance through guidance.

**Common misunderstanding: Minor non-compliance will lead to severe penalties.**

The enforcement approach is designed to be proportional and risk-based. Minor issues might result in guidance or minor notices, while only severe or repeated non-compliance will lead to harsher penalties.
