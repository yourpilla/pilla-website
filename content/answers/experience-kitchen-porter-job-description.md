# What type of experience should I specify in a Kitchen Porter job description?

When writing a job description for a Kitchen Porter, it's important to clearly state the type of experience you're looking for. Consider if the role requires specific skills like handling fast-paced environments or if it's more about general cleaning and maintenance tasks. For most kitchens, highlighting experience in similar environments can help attract candidates who are prepared for the job's demands.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchen porter roles require extensive kitchen experience.**

Not all kitchen porter positions require previous kitchen experience. Many roles are suitable for individuals with general work experience who are eager to learn and adapt. It's important to specify if you're open to training new hires without specific kitchen experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience requirements should be very detailed and strict.**

While it's important to be clear about the experience needed, being too restrictive can deter potentially good candidates who might lack one or two of the specified experiences but are otherwise perfect for the role. Consider listing essential skills and being flexible with others.

## How do I decide between requiring entry-level versus experienced candidates?

Deciding between entry-level and experienced candidates depends on your kitchen's needs and the complexity of the tasks involved. If the role involves basic tasks and you have the capacity to train, entry-level candidates can be ideal. However, for high-volume or specialised kitchens, experienced candidates might be necessary to handle the pace and specific skills required.

**Common misunderstanding: Entry-level candidates cannot handle high-pressure kitchen environments.**

Entry-level candidates, with the right traits and training, can thrive in high-pressure environments. It's about the individual's adaptability and willingness to learn, rather than just their prior experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Experienced candidates do not require any training.**

Even experienced candidates will require some training to adapt to the specific processes and culture of your kitchen. It's important to plan for an orientation period to help even the most experienced hires integrate smoothly.

## Is it beneficial to mention if training will be provided for new hires?

Yes, it is beneficial to mention if training will be provided. This can attract a wider pool of candidates, including those who are eager to enter the hospitality industry but may lack specific kitchen experience. Highlighting training opportunities also demonstrates your commitment to staff development, which can enhance your reputation as an employer.

**Common misunderstanding: Mentioning training might attract only inexperienced candidates.**

While mentioning training can attract those looking to gain experience, it also appeals to experienced candidates who value professional development. It shows that your kitchen invests in its staff.

**Common misunderstanding: Training is only about teaching basic skills.**

Training programs can be comprehensive, covering everything from basic skills to advanced techniques and teamwork. They're not just for novices but are also a way to ensure all staff meet your specific operational standards.
