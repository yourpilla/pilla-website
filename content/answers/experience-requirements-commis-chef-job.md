---
When writing a job description for a Commis Chef, it's important to clearly define the level of experience needed. This helps ensure that the candidates who apply are well-suited for the role and understand what is expected of them. Specify whether you're looking for a trainee, someone with mid-level experience, or a senior chef, and describe the type of kitchen exposure required.

**Common misunderstanding: More years of experience always means a better fit.**

It's not just about how long someone has worked, but where and how they have worked. Focus on the relevance of their experience to your specific kitchen's needs, rather than just the duration.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchen experiences are the same.**

Different kitchens operate differently. Specify if you need someone experienced in high-volume settings, fine dining, or with particular cooking techniques that are critical to your operations.

## What type of culinary experience should I prioritise over sheer duration for a Commis Chef role?

For a Commis Chef position, prioritise specific types of culinary experience that align with your kitchen's operations over the length of time spent in the industry. For example, if your kitchen specialises in fine dining, look for candidates who have experience in similar high-quality settings. This ensures they are familiar with the pace and standards expected.

**Common misunderstanding: Any kitchen experience is sufficient.**

Not all kitchen experiences equip a chef for every type of environment. A chef from a fast-food setting might struggle in a fine dining kitchen without further training, even if they have many years of experience.

**Common misunderstanding: A longer resume means more competence.**

Focus on the relevance of the experience rather than just the length. A few months in a highly relevant role can be more valuable than years in unrelated culinary positions.

## How do I communicate the availability or necessity of training in the job description?

Clearly state in the job description whether training is provided or if the candidate is expected to perform tasks independently from the start. This transparency helps manage expectations and attracts candidates who are prepared for the role as it is structured. If training is provided, highlight this as a benefit, as it can be a significant attraction for those looking to grow their skills.

**Common misunderstanding: Assuming all roles require candidates to be immediately independent.**

Not all positions expect candidates to hit the ground running without any guidance. Specify if your kitchen offers training to ease new hires into their roles.

**Common misunderstanding: Overlooking the appeal of training opportunities in attracting candidates.**

Emphasizing available training can attract candidates who are eager to learn and grow professionally, which can be beneficial for maintaining a motivated and innovative team.
