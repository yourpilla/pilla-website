# What's the correct temperature for a freezer?

The ideal freezer temperature should be -18°C (0°F) or below. At this temperature, all bacterial activity stops completely, keeping your food safe and preventing spoilage. If temperatures rise above -15°C, spoilage organisms can slowly start to multiply.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezing food kills all bacteria, making it safe to eat indefinitely.**

Freezing food at -18°C (0°F) or below does not kill all bacteria; it just stops their growth. Certain bacteria can survive freezing and can become active again when the food is thawed. So it's crucial to handle and cook food properly even after it has been frozen to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the freezer is cold, it doesn't matter how full it is.**

The efficiency of a freezer can be impacted by how full it is. An overfilled freezer can restrict airflow, which leads to uneven temperature distribution and potentially higher temperatures in some areas. To ensure optimal performance, it's important to allow space for air circulation within the freezer.

## How can I make sure my freezer maintains the correct temperature?

Several factors affect freezer performance. Avoid overloading the freezer as this restricts airflow. Keep the door closed as much as possible to prevent temperature fluctuations. Check condensers, vents, and seals weekly for cleanliness and damage. The ambient temperature around the freezer can also impact its performance, so ensure it's not placed in a hot area.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezers in hot kitchens will automatically adjust to maintain the proper temperature.**

Most freezers are designed to maintain their internal temperature independent of external conditions, but they can struggle if placed in extremely hot environments. High ambient temperatures can cause the freezer to work harder, potentially leading to inefficiencies or temperature fluctuations. It's important to place freezers in a cooler area whenever possible to ensure consistent performance.

**Common misunderstanding: Once installed, a freezer doesn't need regular maintenance as long as it keeps cold.**

Regular maintenance is crucial for freezers to ensure they function efficiently. Over time, components like seals and condensers can wear down or become dirty, which can impair performance and lead to higher energy consumption or even failure to maintain the correct temperature. Regular checks and maintenance help prevent these issues and extend the lifespan of the appliance.
