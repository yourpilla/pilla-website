  When testing a food probe thermometer in boiling water, an accurate reading
  ranges between 99°C and 101°C.
---
When testing a probe thermometer in boiling water, you should get a reading of 100°C (212°F). A deviation of 1 degree celsius either way is acceptable, so readings between 99°C and 101°C are considered accurate for the boiling water test.

Remember to submerge the probe at least 2 inches into the water, avoiding contact with the pot's bottom or sides, and wait for the reading to stabilise for at least 10 seconds.

**Common misunderstanding: If a thermometer reads slightly below 100°C in boiling water, it's always faulty.**

Not necessarily. The boiling point of water can vary slightly based on atmospheric pressure, which changes with altitude. At sea level, water boils at 100°C, but at higher altitudes, the boiling point is lower. Therefore, a reading slightly below 100°C might not indicate a fault in the thermometer but rather a difference in atmospheric conditions.

**Common misunderstanding: It's unnecessary to wait for the thermometer reading to stabilise for an accurate result.**

Waiting for the reading to stabilise is crucial for accuracy. Most digital food probe thermometers require a few seconds to adjust to the temperature of the water fully. Failing to wait for stabilisation can lead to inaccurate readings, as the thermometer may initially display a transient temperature that's not representative of the actual boiling water.

## How do I properly set up the boiling water test?

You'll need to use a pot that's deep enough to fully immerse the probe without it touching the bottom or sides. Fill it with boiling water and ensure the probe is submerged properly. Always record your results in the pre-built probe thermometer accuracy test task in Pilla.

**Common misunderstanding: Any pot can be used for the boiling water test as long as the water boils.**

While any pot can technically bring water to a boil, the depth and material of the pot can affect accuracy. A pot that is too shallow won't allow the probe to be fully submerged without touching the bottom, which can lead to incorrect readings due to heat conduction from the pot. It's important to use a pot that allows for proper immersion and is made of a material that doesn't excessively conduct heat to the probe.

**Common misunderstanding: Using tap water instead of distilled water can affect boiling point readings.**

Tap water generally contains minerals and impurities, but these typically do not significantly alter the boiling point. The presence of these impurities may minimally affect the boiling point, but for the purpose of testing thermometers, the impact is negligible. It's more crucial to ensure the thermometer is properly immersed and not touching the pot's sides or bottom for accurate readings.
