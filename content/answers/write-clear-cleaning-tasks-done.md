---
When writing cleaning tasks, be specific and clear. Describe exactly what needs to be done, how it should be done, when it should be completed, and who is responsible. This clarity helps ensure that the tasks are completed correctly and efficiently.

**Common misunderstanding: More details make instructions confusing.**

Actually, detailed instructions help avoid confusion. For example, instead of saying "clean the kitchen," specify "wipe down all countertops with disinfectant and sweep the floor." This tells your team exactly what to do.

**Common misunderstanding: General instructions are enough because everyone knows how to clean.**

Even experienced staff benefit from clear instructions. General terms can lead to inconsistent results because different people might have different ideas of what 'clean' looks like.

## What’s the best way to phrase tasks in a cleaning schedule?

Phrase tasks in an action-oriented, direct manner. Start with a verb, follow with the object needing action, and provide specific details. For example, instead of "the lobby needs to be clean," write "vacuum the lobby carpet and polish the reception desk."

**Common misunderstanding: It’s better to keep instructions short and simple.**

While brevity is important, too little detail can lead to tasks being done poorly. Balance clarity with conciseness.

**Common misunderstanding: Using technical terms makes instructions clearer.**

Use simple language that all team members can understand. Avoid jargon unless it's commonly understood by your staff.

## Why is the “What–How–When–Who” model important?

The “What–How–When–Who” model is crucial because it ensures that every aspect of a task is defined, reducing the chances of misunderstandings or incomplete work. It clarifies what needs to be done, how it should be done, when it must be completed, and who is responsible.

**Common misunderstanding: This model is only useful for large teams.**

Even in small teams, clear communication is key to efficiency. This model helps everyone understand their responsibilities, regardless of team size.

**Common misunderstanding: The model makes task delegation rigid.**

On the contrary, it provides flexibility by clearly defining roles and expectations, allowing team members to manage their time effectively.

## What are examples of vague vs clear cleaning instructions?

Vague instruction: "Clean the dining area." Clear instruction: "Wipe all dining tables with a sanitising solution and sweep the floor area under the tables by 3 PM."

**Common misunderstanding: Vague instructions give staff more flexibility.**

Flexibility doesn't mean lack of clarity. Vague instructions can lead to uneven standards of cleaning. Clear instructions ensure consistency while allowing staff to plan their workflow.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed instructions are only necessary for new employees.**

Even seasoned employees perform better with clear guidelines. This ensures that everyone's work meets the same high standards.
