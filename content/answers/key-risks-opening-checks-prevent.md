---
Opening checks in a kitchen are designed to prevent several key risks that can compromise food safety and kitchen efficiency. These include the use of unsafe food, cross-contamination, equipment failure, and staff illness spreading to food. By conducting thorough opening checks, you ensure that the kitchen is clean, stocked, and fully operational, which helps in avoiding these risks and starting the service on a strong note.

**Common misunderstanding: Opening checks are just about making sure the kitchen looks clean.**

While cleanliness is crucial, opening checks cover more than just surface cleaning. They ensure everything is safe and functional, preventing bigger issues like foodborne illnesses or equipment malfunctions that can disrupt service.

**Common misunderstanding: If the kitchen was closed properly, opening checks can be brief.**

Even with a perfect close, overnight changes or unnoticed issues from the previous day can arise. Opening checks serve as a critical review to catch these potential problems, ensuring nothing is missed.

## What should you check to prevent unsafe food being used in prep?

To prevent the use of unsafe food in preparation, your opening checks should include verifying that all deliveries have been properly accepted, temperature-checked, and labelled. Ensure that foods are stored correctly, with raw meats at the bottom and ready-to-eat foods above, and check that all items are within their use-by dates and properly sealed. This helps in preventing cross-contamination and the use of spoiled or contaminated ingredients.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking the expiry dates on products is enough.**

While checking expiry dates is important, it's also crucial to ensure that the food has been stored at the correct temperatures and that the packaging is intact. This prevents the use of food that might have become unsafe despite being within the expiry date.

**Common misunderstanding: Only meat needs to be temperature checked on delivery.**

All perishable goods, not just meat, should be temperature checked upon delivery. This includes dairy, seafood, and some produce, to ensure they haven't been in the temperature danger zone which could lead to foodborne illnesses.

## How can poor hand hygiene at the start of shift be avoided?

Poor hand hygiene can be effectively avoided by ensuring that all handwashing stations are fully equipped with soap, hot water, and paper towels or hand dryers. It's also important to check that these areas are clean and accessible, not blocked by equipment or supplies. Staff should be trained and reminded regularly about the importance of washing hands before starting their shift, after using the restroom, and when switching between tasks.

**Common misunderstanding: Hand sanitiser can replace washing hands with soap and water.**

Hand sanitiser is a good backup, but it should not replace washing hands with soap and water, which is more effective at removing fats, oils, and certain types of bacteria and viruses.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick rinse under water is sufficient for handwashing.**

Effective handwashing requires at least 20 seconds of scrubbing with soap under running water. A quick rinse won't remove bacteria and viruses effectively, increasing the risk of spreading contaminants.
