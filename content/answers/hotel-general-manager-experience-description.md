# How do I describe the necessary experience in a Hotel General Manager job description?

When writing a job description for a Hotel General Manager, it's important to clearly specify the type and amount of experience required. Focus on practical exposure rather than just years in the industry. For example, if the role is for a luxury hotel, you might require experience in managing high-end services and guest relations.

**Common misunderstanding: Itâ€™s enough to just mention the number of years needed.**

Simply stating the number of years isn't very helpful. It's more useful to describe the kind of experience and the settings in which it was gained. This helps ensure candidates understand what is expected in your specific hotel environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Any general management experience is suitable.**

Not all management experiences are equal. Specify that experience in the hospitality industry, particularly in roles that align with the size and type of your hotel, is necessary. This ensures the candidate's background is relevant to the unique challenges of your hotel.

## Should I focus more on experience type or length for a Hotel General Manager role?

It's more beneficial to focus on the type of experience rather than just the length. Quality and relevance of experience can offer more insight into a candidate's suitability for the role. For instance, experience in a similar hotel environment or specific roles that align with the General Manager's responsibilities is crucial.

**Common misunderstanding: Longer experience always translates to better performance.**

Longer experience doesn't necessarily mean a candidate is the right fit. A candidate with fewer years but more relevant experience might be more suitable, especially if they have proven skills in areas critical to your hotel's operations.

**Common misunderstanding: All types of hospitality experience are equally valuable.**

While general hospitality experience is useful, specific experience that aligns with the daily operations and strategic goals of your hotel is much more valuable. For example, managing a large resort is different from running a boutique hotel.

## What kind of cross-departmental experience is valuable for a Hotel General Manager?

Cross-departmental experience is crucial for a Hotel General Manager, as it ensures they can effectively oversee and connect various aspects of hotel operations. Valuable experiences include managing teams across different departments such as housekeeping, front desk, and food services, as well as working with finance and marketing teams.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience in any single department is sufficient.**

Managing just one department doesn't usually provide the breadth of skills needed for a General Manager role. Experience across multiple departments is essential to understand and integrate the diverse functions of a hotel.

**Common misunderstanding: Technical skills are not as important as leadership skills.**

While leadership is crucial, technical skills related to specific departments (like finance or IT) can greatly enhance a General Manager's effectiveness. Understanding the specifics of each department allows for better decision-making and strategy development.
