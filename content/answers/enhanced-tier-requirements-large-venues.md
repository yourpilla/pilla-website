summary: >-
  Under Martyn's Law, large venues that can host 800 or more people must comply
  with Enhanced Tier security requirements.
---
For large venues that can host 800 or more people at once, Martyn's Law imposes additional security requirements. These venues must not only meet the Standard Tier duties but also take further steps to reduce their vulnerability to terrorist attacks. This includes implementing specific security measures tailored to the risks identified in a thorough risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: All venues need to meet Enhanced Tier requirements.**

Only venues with a capacity of 800 or more people fall into the Enhanced Tier. Smaller venues, even if they are public, only need to meet Standard Tier requirements unless they occasionally host larger events that push them into the Enhanced Tier for those events.

**Common misunderstanding: Enhanced Tier requirements are optional.**

Compliance with Enhanced Tier requirements under Martyn's Law is mandatory for large venues. Failing to comply can lead to significant penalties, including fines and possible closure.

It's advisable that all businesses (even except businesses) carry out a terrorism risk assessment and staff training at a minimum.

## What are public protection measures?

Public protection measures under Martyn's Law refer to proactive steps that venues must take to mitigate risks associated with terrorist attacks. These measures are particularly crucial for Enhanced Tier venues and can include physical security enhancements like CCTV improvements, entry checks, and barriers, as well as operational procedures such as bag searches and staff training in security protocols.

**Common misunderstanding: Public protection measures are the same as emergency procedures.**

While emergency procedures focus on response during an incident, public protection measures are preventative, aiming to reduce risk and deter potential attacks.

**Common misunderstanding: Simple measures like locking doors are sufficient for compliance.**

While basic security practices are part of public protection, Martyn's Law requires a comprehensive approach tailored to the specific risks of the venue, which might include advanced security technologies and detailed operational plans.

## What must be included in a security plan document?

The security plan document for Enhanced Tier venues under Martyn's Law must detail both the public protection procedures and the measures put in place to prevent terrorist attacks. It should include a risk assessment, a rationale for the chosen security measures, and an explanation of how these measures address identified risks. This document is submitted to the regulator to demonstrate compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: The security plan is just a formality.**

The security plan is a critical component of compliance with Martyn's Law. It must be thorough and reflective of actual security practices at the venue. Regulators review these documents to ensure venues are taking their security obligations seriously.

**Common misunderstanding: Once submitted, the security plan need not be updated.**

Security plans must be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in the venue's layout, usage, or emerging threats. Ongoing compliance requires that the document remains accurate and relevant.
