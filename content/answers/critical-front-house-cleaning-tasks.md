After each guest leaves, it's vital to quickly reset the area to maintain cleanliness and ensure the next guest walks into a welcoming environment. Key tasks include sanitising table tops, chair backs, and arm rests, wiping and resetting menus, condiments, and cutlery, cleaning and repositioning high chairs or booster seats, checking the floor area under and around the table, sanitising handheld devices like ordering tablets and card machines, and removing any crumbs and fingerprints from tabletop surfaces.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick wipe of the table is enough after each guest.**

Just wiping the table might leave behind germs or residues. It’s important to use a food-safe disinfectant and ensure all touchpoints like chair backs and arm rests are also sanitised to prevent cross-contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s not necessary to clean under the table or chairs after every guest.**

Food particles and other debris can accumulate under the table and on chairs, which can attract pests and create an unclean appearance. Always check and clean these areas to maintain a high standard of hygiene and comfort.

## How often should high chairs and booster seats be cleaned in a FOH schedule?

High chairs and booster seats should be cleaned and sanitised after every use to ensure they are safe and hygienic for each child. Additionally, a thorough check for food debris and any wear or damage should be part of the daily cleaning routine. This ensures that all parts of the high chair or booster seat, including straps, buckles, tray edges, and legs, are free from hidden food debris and are in good condition.

**Common misunderstanding: High chairs and booster seats only need a quick wipe.**

Given that young children are particularly vulnerable to germs, a simple wipe is not enough. It’s essential to use a food-safe disinfectant and thoroughly clean all parts of the chairs and seats to prevent bacterial growth and ensure child safety.

**Common misunderstanding: High chairs and booster seats do not need to be checked daily.**

Daily checks are necessary not only for cleanliness but also to assess any potential damage or wear that could compromise the safety of the child. Regular inspections help maintain the integrity and safety of these essential items.
