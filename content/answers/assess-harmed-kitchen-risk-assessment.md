When conducting a kitchen risk assessment, it's crucial to identify not just the hazards, but also who could be harmed by them. This involves thinking about all the different types of people who interact with your kitchen, from staff to occasional visitors, and how they might be affected by the specific hazards present.

**Common misunderstanding: Only kitchen staff are at risk.**

It's not just the kitchen staff who face risks. Delivery drivers, engineers, and even front of house staff who might enter the kitchen briefly are all at potential risk and should be considered in your risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: It's enough to just list the hazards.**

Listing hazards is only the first step. You must also think about who is exposed to these hazards and how they could be harmed, which requires a detailed understanding of kitchen operations and the roles of different individuals.

## Which job roles should I consider in my kitchen risk assessment?

In your kitchen risk assessment, you should consider every individual who might enter or work in the kitchen. This includes chefs, kitchen porters (KPs), prep staff, delivery drivers, and even front of house staff. Each role has different interactions with the kitchen environment, which can expose them to unique risks.

**Common misunderstanding: All staff face the same risks.**

Each job role has specific tasks and responsibilities that expose them to different hazards. For example, chefs might be at risk from burns and cuts, while KPs might be more exposed to slips and chemical hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: Temporary staff and visitors donâ€™t need to be considered.**

Even those who are not regularly in the kitchen, like maintenance workers or first-time delivery drivers, must be considered in the risk assessment, as they might not be familiar with the kitchen's layout and potential hazards.

## How do I describe how someone could be harmed in a kitchen?

To effectively describe how someone could be harmed, focus on specific scenarios that illustrate the interaction between the person and the hazard. For example, detail how a chef could suffer a burn from splashing oil or how a delivery driver might slip on a wet floor. This helps in understanding the real-world implications of each hazard.

**Common misunderstanding: General descriptions of harm are sufficient.**

Vague descriptions like 'might get hurt' are not helpful. Be specific about the type of injury and how it could occur, as this will guide effective control measures.

**Common misunderstanding: Only severe injuries need to be described.**

All potential injuries, no matter how minor they might seem, should be described. Even small cuts or slight burns can have serious consequences if not properly managed.
