  If you find pest damage in a food delivery, immediately reject the affected
  items.
---
\`\`\`html




If you discover any signs of pest activity, damage, or ingress in your food delivery, you must reject those items immediately. Make sure to clearly label the affected items as "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area away from other products until they can be returned to the supplier.

Contact your supplier right away to report the issue. Remember to document this rejection in your delivery checks using the pre-built food delivery task in Pilla.

**Common misunderstanding: If only one part of a shipment shows pest damage, it means the rest of the delivery is safe to use.**

This is a common misconception. Pest activity is often not confined to just one part of a shipment. Pests can easily move between packages, and contamination can spread through contact with pest-contaminated surfaces. It's crucial to inspect the entire delivery thoroughly, as pests can leave behind harmful pathogens that aren't visible to the naked eye.

**Common misunderstanding: Pest damage in food delivery is solely the supplier's fault and not a concern for the receiver.**

While suppliers are responsible for ensuring pest-free deliveries, the receiving entity must also play a crucial role by thoroughly inspecting all deliveries upon arrival. This helps in early detection and prevention of potential infestations within your premises, safeguarding food safety standards.

## How do I check for pest activity on food deliveries?

To check for pest activity on food deliveries, carefully inspect all packaging for any signs of damage such as holes, gnaw marks, or tears. Look for any visible pests like insects or rodents, and check for droppings or unusual odours that might indicate pest presence. Make sure that the delivery area is clean and free from potential pest attractants.

**Common misunderstanding: If the packaging looks intact, there is no need to check for pests.**

Even if the packaging appears undamaged, it's important to perform a thorough inspection as small pests can enter through very tiny openings or might be inside the product itself. Always ensure a detailed check.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick visual inspection is enough to make sure there are no pests.**

A detailed inspection involves more than a quick look. You should also check for subtle signs like pest droppings, unusual smells, or any residue on the packaging which could indicate a pest problem.

## Should I still accept the rest of the delivery if only some items show pest damage?

You'll need to carefully inspect every item in the delivery. While you can accept items that show no signs of pest activity, you should be extra vigilant in checking the entire delivery. Look for any signs of damage, holes, or pest evidence in packaging. If you're unsure about any items, it's better to reject them to maintain food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Rejecting a part of the delivery due to pest damage will not affect the rest of the inventory.**

This myth can lead to significant food safety risks. Accepting unaffected items without thorough inspection can result in overlooking cross-contamination or spread of pests, which can compromise the entire inventory. Consistently applying rigorous inspection protocols is essential to prevent widespread contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: If pest damage is minor, it can be ignored and the items can be used.**

Any level of pest damage should not be ignored, regardless of its perceived severity. Even minor pest damage can indicate a larger underlying issue and can lead to contamination with pathogens or allergens. It is important to adhere to food safety protocols by rejecting any damaged goods.

## What should I do to prevent this happening again?

The best prevention is to work only with approved, reputable suppliers who have robust food safety management systems in place. Look for suppliers with external accreditations like BRC (British Retail Consortium) or SALSA (Safe and Local Supplier Approval). These suppliers undergo strict audits and are more likely to maintain high standards in their supply chain.

If you experience repeated issues with pest-damaged deliveries from a particular supplier, this should be escalated to management for review of the supplier relationship.

**Common misunderstanding: Once you have a reputable supplier, you don't need to worry about pest damage.**

Even when working with reputable suppliers, it is crucial to maintain ongoing vigilance and regular audits. Pests can infiltrate supply chains due to various factors beyond the supplier's control, such as environmental changes or transport conditions. Continuous monitoring and adherence to strict food safety practices are essential.

**Common misunderstanding: Pest control measures by suppliers are sufficient to ensure no pest issues in deliveries.**

While suppliers implement pest control measures, these are not infallible. External factors such as transit conditions or storage environments can introduce risks. It is imperative for receiving businesses to conduct their own inspections and maintain robust storage protocols to ensure product safety.
