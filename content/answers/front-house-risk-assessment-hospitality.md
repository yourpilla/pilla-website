  identify, evaluate, and address potential hazards in public-facing areas of
  venues like restaurants or bars.
---
A front of house (FOH) risk assessment in hospitality is a process used to identify, analyze, and manage potential risks in the public-facing areas of a restaurant, bar, or similar venue. This includes evaluating hazards that could affect customers and staff during service hours. The assessment aims to ensure safety and compliance with legal requirements by documenting hazards, assessing who might be harmed, and determining necessary control measures.

**Common misunderstanding: A risk assessment is only about preventing major accidents.**

While preventing accidents is crucial, risk assessments also focus on minimizing smaller hazards that can lead to injuries or operational issues. This includes managing risks like spills, trips, or allergen miscommunication.

**Common misunderstanding: Once completed, no further action is required.**

Completing the assessment is just the beginning. It's vital to implement the identified control measures, monitor their effectiveness, and update the assessment regularly or when changes occur in the FOH environment.

## Why is a separate front of house risk assessment necessary in hospitality?

Front of house areas in hospitality settings have unique risks that differ significantly from those in the kitchen or back of house. These areas are highly dynamic and interact directly with customers, involving risks related to customer service, movement of people, and public interaction. A separate FOH risk assessment is necessary to specifically address these risks, ensuring that all potential hazards are identified and managed appropriately to protect both staff and patrons.

**Common misunderstanding: A general risk assessment for the entire venue is sufficient.**

A general assessment might overlook specific hazards unique to FOH operations, such as customer flow, interaction points, and specific equipment used only in these areas.

**Common misunderstanding: FOH risks are less serious and can be managed informally.**

Even seemingly minor FOH risks can lead to significant incidents if not properly managed. Formal risk assessments help ensure all potential issues are systematically addressed and controlled.

## Who should complete the front of house risk assessment?

The FOH risk assessment should ideally be completed by someone with thorough knowledge of the daily operations and layout of the front of house area, such as a Restaurant Manager, Bar Manager, or Supervisor. These individuals are familiar with the typical flow of service, common pressure points, and real-life issues that may not be apparent to someone less involved in day-to-day operations.

**Common misunderstanding: Any staff member can conduct the risk assessment.**

While any staff member can contribute to identifying hazards, the assessment should be led by someone with management responsibilities and a comprehensive understanding of FOH operations to ensure it is thorough and effective.

**Common misunderstanding: The assessment needs to be done by an external consultant.**

External consultants can provide valuable insights, but it's not a requirement. An experienced internal staff member can effectively perform the assessment, especially when using structured tools like the Pilla restaurant risk assessment template.
