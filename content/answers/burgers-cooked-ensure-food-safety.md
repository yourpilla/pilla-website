# How should burgers be cooked to ensure food safety?

Burgers must be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 75°C (167°F) for at least 30 seconds. This temperature ensures that all harmful bacteria, such as E. coli, are killed. Always use a food thermometer to check the temperature at the thickest part of the burger.

**Common misunderstanding: Burgers are safe to eat once they are brown in the middle.**

Browning does not guarantee that the burger has reached a safe internal temperature. Always use a thermometer to check.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking burgers on a high flame for a short time is sufficient.**

While high heat can cook the outer parts of the burger quickly, it does not ensure the middle reaches the necessary temperature. Consistent, thorough cooking is required.

## Why can't burgers be served undercooked?

Serving undercooked burgers poses a significant health risk as they may contain harmful bacteria like E. coli, which can cause severe foodborne illnesses. These bacteria are only killed when the burger is cooked thoroughly to the correct internal temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: A customer's preference for a rare burger is a valid reason to serve it undercooked.**

Despite customer preferences, food safety best practices must be followed to prevent illness. Health standards come first.

**Common misunderstanding: Undercooked burgers are safe if the meat quality is high.**

Even high-quality meats can harbour bacteria. Cooking to the right temperature is the only way to ensure safety.

## What is the recommended shelf life for in-house prepared burgers?

In-house prepared burgers should be used within 3 days, including the day of preparation. This timeframe helps ensure the burgers remain fresh and minimises the risk of bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: Burgers can be kept as long as they smell fine.**

Smell is not a reliable indicator of safety. Bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses may not affect the smell, taste, or appearance of food.

**Common misunderstanding: Freezing burgers extends their shelf life indefinitely.**

While freezing does extend the life of foods, once thawed, burgers should still be used within the original 3-day timeframe to ensure safety.
