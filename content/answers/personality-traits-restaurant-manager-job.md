Defining the right personality traits for a Restaurant Manager starts by understanding the specific needs and culture of your restaurant. Think about the traits that have helped your team succeed and those that align with your restaurant's values and customer service style. Include clear examples of these traits in the job description to attract candidates who are a good fit.

**Common misunderstanding: Broad traits like "good communication" are enough.**

While it's true that good communication is important, it's too vague. Be specific about what kind of communication is needed. For example, does the manager need to be great at motivating staff, handling customer complaints, or perhaps negotiating with suppliers?

**Common misunderstanding: All managers should have the same standard traits.**

Different restaurant environments require different types of managers. A bustling, fast-paced diner might need a manager who thrives under pressure and can make quick decisions, while a high-end restaurant might require someone with a focus on meticulous attention to detail and a calm demeanour.

## What should I observe in my team to better define the personality fit for a Restaurant Manager?

Observe the interactions and performance of your current team to identify which personality traits contribute to both individual and group success. Look at how your team handles daily challenges, interacts with customers, and works together. Note the traits that help maintain a positive and productive work environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Only positive traits should be considered.**

It's also useful to recognize which traits have not worked well in your team. Understanding these can help you avoid hiring someone with similar characteristics that might disrupt team dynamics.

**Common misunderstanding: Immediate observations are enough to define personality fit.**

Personality fit isn't always obvious in short-term observations. It's important to consider long-term interactions and the overall impact a person has on team morale and performance over time.

## How can I express the desired energy and interactive style in a Restaurant Manager job description?

Clearly articulate the energy level and style of interaction you expect from your Restaurant Manager. Describe how these traits should manifest in day-to-day operations and customer interactions. Use specific examples, such as the need for high energy during peak hours or a calm, reassuring presence in high-end service settings.

**Common misunderstanding: Energy and style are inherent and cannot be influenced.**

While some traits are innate, many aspects of a person's professional demeanor can be developed. Highlight that you value both natural affinity and the willingness to adapt and grow into the restaurant's culture.

**Common misunderstanding: Describing desired energy and style might limit the pool of applicants.**

Being specific about the energy and interactive style helps ensure that you attract candidates who are more likely to thrive in your restaurant's environment, reducing turnover and fostering a better workplace.
