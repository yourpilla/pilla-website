When writing a job description for a Catering Assistant, clearly outline the customer service skills required. Mention how they should interact with guests, manage inquiries, and handle any issues that arise. This helps potential candidates understand what will be expected from them in terms of guest interaction and service quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Customer service skills are not as important for a Catering Assistant as they are for front-of-house staff.**

Even though Catering Assistants may not always be the primary customer-facing role, their interaction with guests and their ability to handle service-related tasks directly impact the overall customer experience. They need strong communication skills and a friendly attitude.

**Common misunderstanding: Itâ€™s enough to just mention that good customer service is required.**

Simply stating that good customer service is required isn't enough. Be specific about what this means in your setting. Does it include greeting guests, responding to requests, or managing buffet lines? Specific examples help candidates better understand their role.

## What if the role involves both kitchen and front-of-house support?

If the Catering Assistant role requires both kitchen and front-of-house duties, specify this clearly in the job description. Outline the expectations for each area and how they should balance their responsibilities. This helps candidates gauge if they can handle the diverse aspects of the job and meet the demands of both environments.

**Common misunderstanding: If someone has kitchen experience, they automatically qualify for front-of-house duties.**

Having kitchen experience is valuable, but front-of-house duties often require different skills, such as direct guest interaction and a high level of personal presentation. Make sure to list specific front-of-house skills needed, like customer service and communication.

**Common misunderstanding: The role is mostly about food preparation, with little emphasis on guest interaction.**

Even if the role includes significant time in the kitchen, the ability to switch to guest-facing duties is crucial. Clearly describe how they need to support both areas effectively, ensuring a seamless dining experience for guests.

## How do I highlight a balance between efficiency and hospitality?

In the job description, emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between efficient service and excellent hospitality. Describe how the Catering Assistant should manage their tasks quickly without compromising on the quality of guest interaction and service.

**Common misunderstanding: Efficiency means doing tasks as quickly as possible, regardless of the guest experience.**

While speed is important, it should not detract from the guest experience. Explain that efficiency in this role means managing tasks in a timely manner while still being attentive and courteous to guests.

**Common misunderstanding: High-quality hospitality can only be achieved by taking more time with each guest.**

Quality hospitality doesn't necessarily mean spending more time with each guest but rather making sure each interaction is meaningful and positive. Stress the need for effective time management that allows for both quick service and memorable guest interactions.
