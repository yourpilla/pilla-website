Yes, you can use cling film as long as it's food-grade wrapping. It's important to note that you must never use tea towels or cloths to cover food in display fridges. Make sure your display fridge also has proper sneeze guards or screening to protect the food.

**Common misunderstanding: Cling film is not suitable for long-term food storage in display fridges because it doesn't adhere well and can lead to contamination.**

While cling film is indeed suitable for short-term use, it must be food-grade and properly sealed to ensure protection against contaminants. For longer-term storage, consider using food-grade containers with tight-fitting lids to maintain hygiene and prevent any cross-contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to use any type of plastic wrap to cover food in display fridges as long as it covers the food completely.**

Not all plastic wraps are suitable for food use. Only food-grade plastic wraps should be used, as they are specifically designed to prevent chemical leaching and ensure the safety of the food. Always verify that the cling film is certified for food contact before use.

## What about if I run out of cling film, can I use a clean tea towel temporarily?

No, avoid using cloths or tea towels to cover food. You must only use food-grade storage containers or food-grade wrapping materials. This is to prevent physical, allergenic and microbiological contamination of the food.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a clean tea towel is perfectly fine if it's just for a short period.**

Even for short periods, using a tea towel poses risks of physical and microbiological contamination. Tea towels can harbour bacteria and other contaminants that can transfer to food, compromising its safety. Always opt for food-grade wrapping materials or containers, even in temporary situations.

**Common misunderstanding: If the tea towel is washed regularly, it's hygienic enough to cover food.**

Despite regular washing, tea towels can still carry lint, fibers, and bacteria that are not visible to the naked eye. These contaminants can easily transfer to food, making it unsafe for consumption. Always use materials specifically designated for food contact to ensure safety.

## Do I need to cover everything in the display fridge?

Yes, all foods that are stored or displayed in refrigerated units must be adequately covered. This is a crucial food safety requirement to protect against contamination. Even with sneeze guards in place, proper food covering is still required.
