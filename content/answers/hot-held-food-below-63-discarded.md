If the temperature of hot held food falls below 63°C, it's important to act quickly. You should either reheat the food to at least 75°C and then return it to hot holding, or cool it down quickly to store in the fridge if it cannot be reheated immediately.

**Common misunderstanding: Food can be left out for a few hours even if it falls below 63°C.**

Leaving food out below 63°C for more than a short period can increase the risk of bacterial growth. It's important to manage the temperature of hot held food to prevent foodborne illness.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s safe to just turn up the heat on the hot holding equipment to bring the temperature back up.**

Simply turning up the heat might not reheat the food evenly or quickly enough. It's safer to reheat the food using a stove or microwave to ensure it reaches the correct temperature throughout before placing it back into hot holding.

## How long can food be kept below 63°C before it must be discarded?

Food should not be kept below 63°C for more than 2 hours. If the food has been below this temperature for longer, it should be discarded to avoid the risk of foodborne illness.

**Common misunderstanding: Food can be safely kept below 63°C as long as it tastes fine.**

Taste is not a reliable indicator of safety. Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses do not always affect the taste, smell, or appearance of food.

**Common misunderstanding: If food is only slightly below 63°C, it’s still safe for longer periods.**

Even a small drop below 63°C can create a risk for bacterial growth. It’s important to strictly follow safety guidelines to ensure food safety.

## Can food be reheated and put back into hot holding safely?

Yes, food can be reheated and put back into hot holding, but it must be reheated to at least 75°C for at least 30 seconds before being placed back into hot holding. This ensures that any potential bacteria are killed.

**Common misunderstanding: Food can be reheated to any temperature before being put back into hot holding.**

Reheating food to just any warm temperature is not enough. It must reach at least 75°C to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: You can reheat food multiple times as long as it reaches the safe temperature.**

It is generally advised to limit the number of times food is reheated to prevent quality degradation and to ensure safety. Reheating food multiple times can increase the risk of foodborne illness.
