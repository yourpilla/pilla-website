Placing hot food directly into a refrigerator can lead to a rise in the appliance's internal temperature. This can endanger all stored food by creating an environment where bacteria can multiply quickly. It’s important to cool food to room temperature or use rapid cooling methods before refrigerating to maintain food safety and appliance efficiency.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to put hot food in the fridge if I leave the fridge door open for a bit.**

Leaving the fridge door open to cool hot food is not effective and can actually raise the temperature inside the fridge, putting all stored food at risk. Always cool food outside the fridge first.

**Common misunderstanding: If my fridge is set to a very cold temperature, it can handle hot food without any problems.**

Even if the fridge is set to a lower temperature, introducing hot food can cause temperature fluctuations that can lead to food spoilage and increased risk of foodborne illnesses. Always cool food before placing it in the fridge.

## What risks arise from introducing hot food into a cooled unit?

Introducing hot food into a refrigerator can cause the overall temperature inside the unit to increase, potentially bringing it into the 'danger zone' (between 5°C and 50°C) where bacteria multiply fastest. This can compromise the safety of all food stored within the unit and increase the risk of foodborne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: A few minutes of higher temperature won’t really affect the safety of other foods.**

Even a small amount of time in the danger zone can be enough for bacteria to begin to multiply on some foods, especially those that are more susceptible to spoilage. Every minute counts when it comes to food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: My fridge cools down quickly, so it can handle the temporary rise in temperature.**

While some modern fridges can recover temperature faster than older models, consistently introducing hot food can strain the appliance, lead to higher energy consumption, and still risk food safety.

## How can placing hot food in a fridge affect other items stored there?

Placing hot food in a fridge can raise the internal temperature, affecting other items stored inside. This can lead to uneven cooling and potential spoilage of food, especially items that are more temperature-sensitive or placed close to the hot food.

**Common misunderstanding: If I place hot food on one shelf, it won’t affect items on other shelves.**

Heat rises and the circulation of air inside a fridge can spread the warmth from hot food, affecting items on other shelves. It’s best to cool food outside the fridge to avoid this issue.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the hot food is covered, it won’t affect other items in the fridge.**

Covering hot food does help contain some of the heat, but it doesn’t prevent the overall internal temperature of the fridge from rising, which can still impact other stored foods. Cooling food before refrigeration is always the safest practice.
