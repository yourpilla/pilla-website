# How do I identify hazards in my front of house risk assessment?

To effectively identify hazards in your front of house area, walk through the space during actual service hours. This allows you to observe how customers and staff interact and move in real-time, helping you spot potential risks that might not be apparent when the area is empty.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s sufficient to do the assessment when the area is quiet.**

Assessing the area only when it's quiet can miss many potential hazards that occur during busy times, such as customer queues or staff moving quickly through crowded spaces. Always assess during various service times to get a complete picture.

**Common misunderstanding: A general site-wide risk assessment is enough for the front of house.**

A general risk assessment might not capture specific hazards unique to front of house areas, like bar counters or customer interaction zones. It's important to conduct a dedicated assessment for these areas.

## What are common hazards in front of house hospitality areas?

Common hazards in front of house areas include slippery floors, especially near entrances or bar areas; manual handling risks like carrying heavy trays; electrical hazards from equipment; and fire risks from candles or decorations near heat sources. Interactions with the public can also pose risks, such as allergen miscommunication or aggressive behaviour from customers.

**Common misunderstanding: Only physical hazards need to be considered.**

While physical hazards are crucial, it's also important to consider non-physical risks such as allergen miscommunication or customer aggression, which can also significantly impact safety and health.

**Common misunderstanding: Hazards are constant and don’t vary by time or day.**

Hazards can change depending on the time of day and the level of business. For example, risks may increase during peak hours due to higher foot traffic and faster service demands. Always consider varying conditions in your risk assessment.

## When is the best time to walk the front of house to spot risks?

The best time to walk the front of house to identify risks is during various service times such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and close-down. Observing the area during these different periods helps you see how hazards change with the flow of customers and the type of service being provided.

**Common misunderstanding: Once is enough to understand all the risks.**

Walking through the area just once might not give you a full understanding of all potential risks, as hazards can vary significantly between different times and service types. Multiple walks at different times are essential.

**Common misunderstanding: Checking during any service time is effective.**

While checking during any service time is good, it’s best to assess during peak times when the likelihood and impact of hazards are greatest. This approach ensures you're planning for the worst-case scenarios.
