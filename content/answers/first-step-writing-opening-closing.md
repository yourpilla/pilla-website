The first step in creating effective opening and closing checklists for your kitchen is to perform a detailed walkthrough of the kitchen. This involves observing the kitchen as if you are seeing it for the first time, ideally at the start of the day before opening and after closing. This helps you identify what needs to be ready for the kitchen to operate smoothly and what needs cleaning or restocking at the end of the day.

**Common misunderstanding: You can skip the walkthrough if you know your kitchen well.**

Even if you're familiar with your kitchen, a walkthrough is crucial. It helps spot details that you might overlook daily due to familiarity. This step ensures nothing important is missed in your checklists.

**Common misunderstanding: The walkthrough only needs to be done once.**

A single walkthrough isn't enough. Regular walkthroughs are important as they help update and refine the checklists based on changes in the kitchen operations or layout, ensuring they remain relevant and effective.

## Why should you do a kitchen walkthrough before writing checklists?

Conducting a kitchen walkthrough before drafting your checklists is essential because it allows you to see the kitchen from a fresh perspective, similar to that of a health inspector. This process helps you identify potential risks and operational needs that might not be obvious during regular kitchen activities. It ensures that your checklists cover all critical areas that maintain safety, hygiene, and efficiency from the start to the end of the day.

**Common misunderstanding: A walkthrough is just a quick look around the kitchen.**

A thorough walkthrough is more than a casual glance; it involves a detailed inspection of every area of the kitchen to ensure everything is in its place, functioning properly, and adheres to hygiene standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Walkthroughs are only necessary for larger kitchens.**

No matter the size of the kitchen, walkthroughs are crucial. They help small kitchens operate efficiently and safely, just as much as they do in larger operations.

## What kind of issues can you identify during a kitchen walkthrough?

During a kitchen walkthrough, you can identify a range of issues that might affect the kitchen's operation. These include safety hazards like slippery floors or improperly stored sharp objects, hygiene issues such as unlabelled food or inadequate sanitisation, and operational problems like inefficient layout of tools and ingredients. Identifying these issues early helps prevent food safety violations, workplace accidents, and inefficiencies during service.

**Common misunderstanding: Only visible cleanliness issues are important during a walkthrough.**

Beyond cleanliness, it's important to check for functional issues like the working condition of equipment, proper food storage, and the availability of cleaning supplies. These elements are crucial for a smooth operation.

**Common misunderstanding: If something was fine yesterday, it will be fine today.**

Conditions in a kitchen can change overnight, such as equipment malfunctions or pest infestations. Regular walkthroughs help catch these changes quickly, maintaining a safe and efficient kitchen environment.
