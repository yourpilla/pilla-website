# If the power goes out, how long will food stay frozen?

The key is to keep the freezer door closed as much as possible during a power outage. If the food still feels hard and is covered in ice, it's safe to transfer to another freezer unit. If food has started to soften and ice is melting, you'll need to move it to a fridge for controlled defrosting and use within 48 hours.

Remember: Never refreeze food that has defrosted, and if you're unsure about cross-contamination, it's safer to discard the food.

**Common misunderstanding: You can refreeze food after a power outage if it still feels cold.**

Although the food may feel cold, refreezing it after it has partially defrosted can be risky. The food may not have maintained a safe temperature, allowing bacteria to grow. Refreezing can also degrade the quality of the food.

**Common misunderstanding: If the freezer is full, the food will stay frozen for days during a power outage.**

While a full freezer can maintain its temperature longer than a half-empty one, the duration is still limited. Typically, a full freezer will keep food safe for about 48 hours, and a half-full freezer for about 24 hours, provided the door remains closed.

## What about ice cream and other foods that must stay frozen?

Items like ice cream that must remain frozen for safety reasons need to either be used immediately or discarded if they've started to defrost. These items cannot be refrozen under any circumstances.

**Common misunderstanding: Ice cream can be refrozen if it still has ice crystals.**

Even if ice cream still has ice crystals, refreezing it is not safe. The texture and safety of ice cream are compromised once it begins to melt, as this can encourage bacterial growth that refreezing will not eliminate.

**Common misunderstanding: If ice cream is consumed immediately after it melts, it is safe regardless of how long it's been defrosted.**

While consuming melted ice cream quickly can minimise some risks, any period at an unsafe temperature can allow bacteria to grow. It's best to discard ice cream that has melted significantly to ensure food safety.

## How can I tell if food has defrosted too much to be saved?

If food is still hard and covered in ice, it's safe to transfer to another freezer. If it's starting to soften but still cold, move it to a fridge and use within 48 hours. However, if the food is soft and warm to touch, it needs to be discarded immediately. For raw meat and poultry that's beginning to defrost, you might be able to use it immediately if appropriate, but never refreeze it.

**Common misunderstanding: You can rely solely on smell to determine if defrosted food is still safe to eat.**

Relying on smell is not a reliable indicator of food safety. Many harmful bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses do not affect the smell of food. It's important to consider temperature and texture, and when in doubt, discard the food.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as defrosted food is cooked thoroughly, it's always safe to eat.**

While cooking can kill many bacteria, it does not eliminate all food safety risks. Some toxins produced by bacteria remain even after cooking. Thus, if food has been at an unsafe temperature for too long, it should be discarded regardless of cooking.
