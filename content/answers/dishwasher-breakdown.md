If your dishwasher breaks down during service, immediately stop using it to prevent any further issues. Switch to manual dishwashing and report the breakdown to a manager using the Pilla app. Make sure to follow the corrective actions listed to maintain hygiene and safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: You can continue using the dishwasher until the end of service before reporting it.**

Continuing to use a broken dishwasher can increase the problem and compromise the cleanliness of your dishes. It's important to stop using it immediately and switch to manual washing.

**Common misunderstanding: Towel drying dishes after manual washing is acceptable if the dishwasher breaks down.**

Always allow dishes to air-dry after manual washing. Towel drying can spread contaminants and compromise the sanitation process.

**Common misunderstanding: Reporting the issue to a supervisor in person is enough.**

While informing a supervisor directly is helpful, officially logging the issue in Pilla creates a digital paper-trail which is crucial for compliance and inspections.

**Common misunderstanding: You only need to report major breakdowns.**

All breakdowns, regardless of their perceived severity, should be reported to make sure of proper tracking and resolution.

## What immediate steps should I take after identifying a breakdown?

After identifying a dishwasher breakdown, prioritise washing essential items manually and maintain frequent handwashing and glove use among staff handling dishes.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to delay manual washing if the breakdown seems minor.**

Even minor breakdowns can affect the sanitation level of dishes. Switch to manual washing immediately to ensure all dishes are properly cleaned and sanitised.

**Common misunderstanding: Manual washing is as effective as machine washing.**

Manual washing might not achieve the same level of cleanliness and sanitisation as machine washing, so it’s important to be extra thorough and inspect all dishes closely.
