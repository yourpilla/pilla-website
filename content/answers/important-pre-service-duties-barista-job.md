Before the café opens, baristas have several key tasks to prepare for the day. These include setting up the coffee station, dialling in grinders and the espresso machine, and ensuring all supplies like milk, cups, and cleaning materials are fully stocked. It's also crucial to clean and sanitise work surfaces and equipment before service begins.

**Common misunderstanding: Pre-service duties are just about setting up the coffee machine.**

While preparing the coffee machine is important, pre-service duties also involve broader preparation like stocking and cleaning. This ensures everything runs smoothly from the moment the first customer walks in.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to do some cleaning tasks later in the day.**

Starting the day with a clean and organised station is essential for efficiency and food safety. Delaying cleaning can lead to cross-contamination and a disorganised work environment, impacting service quality.

## How do I break down barista responsibilities during active service?

During active service, baristas are primarily responsible for making coffee and may also handle customer orders and payments if required. Key responsibilities include maintaining the quality and speed of coffee preparation, managing the coffee order flow with front-of-house staff, and keeping the workstation clean and well-stocked. Communication with team members is crucial to manage wait times and ensure a smooth service.

**Common misunderstanding: Baristas only need to focus on making coffee.**

While coffee making is their main task, baristas also need to engage with customers, manage stock levels, and maintain cleanliness, which are all vital for efficient operation.

**Common misunderstanding: If the café is not busy, other tasks can be ignored.**

Even during slower periods, it’s important for baristas to prepare for upcoming rushes, restock, and keep their area clean. This proactive approach prevents issues when the pace picks up again.

## What should I include for end-of-shift tasks in the barista job description?

End-of-shift tasks are crucial for closing the day properly and setting up the next shift for success. These include cleaning and backflushing the espresso machine and grinders, restocking the station for the next day, and washing and sanitising jugs, tools, and work surfaces. Completing daily cleaning and waste disposal tasks are also part of the closing duties.

**Common misunderstanding: Thorough cleaning can be done periodically, not necessarily daily.**

Daily cleaning is essential to maintain equipment and ensure hygiene standards are met. This prevents buildup and potential health hazards.

**Common misunderstanding: Restocking can be done the next morning.**

Restocking and preparing the station at the end of each shift ensure that the morning crew can start service immediately, which is crucial for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
