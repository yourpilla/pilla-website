You must obtain written confirmation of their food hygiene qualifications before allowing them to work in kitchen areas or handle any food. Agency workers cannot handle food until their qualifications have been verified - this is a strict requirement to maintain food safety standards.

Make sure to record their certificate details in the Training activity section of Pilla, including uploading a photo of their certificate for future reference.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as an agency worker has a food hygiene certificate from any source, it's valid for use in any establishment.**

Not all food hygiene certificates are created equal. Best practice is to verify that the certificate is recognised by relevant local or national food safety authorities. Certificates from unaccredited sources may not meet the necessary standards, potentially compromising food safety in your establishment.

**Common misunderstanding: Once an agency worker's food hygiene certificate is validated upon initial hiring, it doesn't need to be checked again.**

Food hygiene certificates often have an expiration date and may require renewal or further training to maintain compliance with updated standards. Regular checks should be implemented to ensure all certifications remain valid and up-to-date to uphold food safety.

## What level certificate should agency workers have?

It depends on their role. If they're handling food regularly, especially open or high-risk foods, they need a valid Level 2 food hygiene certificate. If they're in a supervisory position like a sous chef, they need Level 3. For basic roles with no direct food handling, Level 1 is sufficient.

**Common misunderstanding: All kitchen staff, regardless of their specific duties, require the highest level of food hygiene certification.**

The level of food hygiene certification required depends on the specific duties performed. While supervisory roles require Level 3, roles limited to basic tasks with no direct food handling may only necessitate a Level 1 certification. Tailoring certification levels to job roles ensures efficient use of resources while maintaining safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Food hygiene certificates are a one-time requirement and do not need to be renewed or updated.**

Food hygiene standards and regulations evolve over time, requiring periodic updates and renewal of certifications. Continuous education and refresher courses ensure that staff remain informed about the latest food safety practices and regulatory requirements, thus maintaining a high level of safety within the establishment.
