You should inform your head chef if you notice any issues with your probe thermometer. They will need to verify the problem by rechecking the probe's accuracy. If they confirm the probe is faulty, they'll ensure it's taken out of service and arrange for a replacement probe to be made available.

Make sure to record the issue in the probe thermometer accuracy test task in Pilla so there's a record of the problem.

**Common misunderstanding: Only the head chef needs to be aware of thermometer issues.**

While the head chef should be informed first, it's important for the entire kitchen staff to be aware of any issues with equipment like thermometers. This ensures that everyone is vigilant about food safety and aware of potential inaccuracies until the issue is resolved.

## What signs should I look for to know if my probe isn't working properly?

There are several signs that indicate a probe might be faulty:

-   Bent or damaged probe tip
-   Cracked display
-   Foggy interior
-   Unstable readings that don't remain static
-   Temperature readings that deviate more than 1 degree from expected temperatures during calibration tests (100°C for boiling water or 0°C for ice water)

**Common misunderstanding: A probe thermometer with a foggy display can still be used as long as the readings are visible.**

A foggy display often indicates moisture has entered the thermometer, which can affect its accuracy and reliability. Even if the readings are visible, moisture can cause erratic behavior and should be addressed immediately.

**Common misunderstanding: If the probe tip is slightly bent, it won't affect the thermometer's performance.**

A bent probe tip can significantly impact the accuracy of temperature readings, as it may not make proper contact with the food. It's essential to replace a damaged probe to maintain food safety and quality.

## Should I keep using the probe while waiting for a replacement?

No, once a probe has been identified as faulty, it must be immediately taken out of service. Using a faulty probe could lead to incorrect temperature readings which is a food safety risk. The probe should be sent back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement, and you should only use the replacement probe that your head chef provides.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to use a faulty probe for non-critical tasks until a replacement arrives.**

Using a faulty probe for any task is risky because it can provide incorrect temperature readings, leading to potential food safety hazards. It is imperative to remove it from all operations immediately and use a verified replacement.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the probe is cleaned thoroughly, it can be used despite minor faults.**

Cleaning a faulty probe does not correct its inaccuracies. A probe with faults, such as inaccurate readings or physical damage, should not be used under any circumstances, as it could compromise food safety and quality.
