# How should shellfish be cooled safely?

After a busy lunch service, cooling shellfish properly is key to keeping it safe and fresh. Shellfish should be cooled by placing it in a bath of potable ice and water. This method helps lower the temperature quickly and efficiently, reducing the risk of bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: Any type of ice is fine for cooling shellfish.**

It's important to use potable ice for cooling, which means the ice must be made from water that is safe to drink. Using non-potable ice can introduce contaminants to the shellfish, making it unsafe to eat.

**Common misunderstanding: Shellfish can be left at room temperature to cool down before refrigeration.**

Leaving shellfish to cool at room temperature can allow harmful bacteria to multiply quickly. Always cool shellfish rapidly using a bath of potable ice and water to ensure it remains safe to eat.

## When is it allowable to use cold potable water for cooling certain foods?

During a busy kitchen operation, using cold potable water is a quick method to cool certain types of foods like pasta, rice, and vegetables. This method is allowable when you need to rapidly reduce the temperature of these foods to prevent bacterial growth.

**Common misunderstanding: You can use this method for any type of food.**

It's crucial to note that this cooling method is specifically suitable for foods that will not absorb water excessively or lose quality, such as pasta, rice, and vegetables. It's not suitable for all food types.

**Common misunderstanding: The water doesn't need to be changed frequently.**

To maintain effective cooling, the water should be refreshed every 10-20 minutes to ensure it stays cold and continues to effectively remove heat from the food. Neglecting to change the water can slow down the cooling process and increase the risk of bacterial growth.
