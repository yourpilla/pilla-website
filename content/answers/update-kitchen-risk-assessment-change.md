When your kitchen undergoes any changes, it's essential to update your risk assessment to reflect these new conditions. Start by reviewing the existing document and noting any new hazards introduced by the changes. Adjust the risk levels and control measures accordingly. It’s a good practice to involve your team in this process, as they might provide insights into potential risks and effective precautions.

**Common misunderstanding: If the changes are minor, I don’t need to update the risk assessment.**

Even minor changes can significantly impact safety. For example, a new piece of equipment or a slight rearrangement of the workspace can introduce new hazards. Always update your risk assessment, no matter how small the change seems.

**Common misunderstanding: Updates to the risk assessment can be done informally.**

While informal reviews can be helpful for immediate adjustments, formal updates to the risk assessment document are crucial. This ensures that all changes are officially recorded and implemented, maintaining compliance and safety standards.

## What kitchen changes should prompt a risk assessment update?

Several changes in the kitchen environment should prompt an update to your risk assessment. These include introducing new equipment, changes in kitchen layout, hiring new staff, especially if inexperienced, and significant maintenance issues like a failing ventilation system. Each of these changes can introduce new hazards or alter how existing risks are managed.

**Common misunderstanding: Only major renovations require a risk assessment update.**

Any change that could affect how tasks are performed needs a reassessment. Even small adjustments, like changing the location of tools or minor equipment upgrades, can create new risks.

**Common misunderstanding: New equipment only needs to be added to the asset list, not the risk assessment.**

New equipment often comes with new risks, such as increased electrical load or new operational hazards. It’s essential to include these in your risk assessment to ensure all potential risks are managed.

## Should I update my kitchen risk assessment after an accident?

Yes, following any accident or near miss in the kitchen, it's crucial to update your risk assessment. Analyze the incident to understand what went wrong and why. This analysis can help you identify if existing risk controls failed or if new risks have emerged. Updating your assessment helps prevent future incidents by addressing the root cause of the accident.

**Common misunderstanding: An accident needs to result in serious injury to warrant a risk assessment update.**

Any accident, regardless of severity, provides valuable insights into potential safety improvements. Even near misses, where no one was hurt, should trigger a review of your risk assessment.

**Common misunderstanding: If the accident was a result of non-compliance, I don’t need to update the risk assessment.**

Non-compliance might indicate that existing controls are insufficient or not clear enough. Revising your risk assessment can help clarify expectations and strengthen safety protocols, reducing the likelihood of similar incidents.
