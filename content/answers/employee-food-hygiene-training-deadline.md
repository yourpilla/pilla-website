# How soon after starting does a new employee need to complete food hygiene training?

New staff must complete food hygiene training before they start handling any food. This initial training ensures they understand basic food hygiene practices and can work safely from their first day. Even if they have previous experience, they need to demonstrate they have valid certifications before starting.

**Common misunderstanding: If a new employee has prior experience in the food industry, they don't need immediate food hygiene training at a new job.**

Even if a new hire has previous experience, immediate food hygiene training is critical to ensure they are up to date with company-specific protocols and current regulations. Each establishment may have unique practices and standards that must be adhered to, regardless of prior experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Once food hygiene training is completed, there's no need for further updates or re-training.**

Food hygiene standards and regulations are continually evolving. Regular refresher courses and updates are essential to ensure all staff, including new employees, remain compliant with the latest safety standards and practices.

## I'm hiring through an agency - do they need to show their certificates before starting?

Yes, agency workers must provide written confirmation of their food hygiene qualifications before they can handle any food in your kitchen. As a manager, you cannot allow them to handle food until you've verified their qualifications. This protects both your business and customers by maintaining food safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Agency workers can start handling food immediately if the agency assures their certification.**

Relying solely on an agency's assurance without verifying certifications can compromise food safety. It's crucial for managers to independently verify each worker’s certification to ensure compliance and maintain safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: All agency workers carry the same level of food hygiene certification, so specific verification isn't necessary.**

Certification levels can vary widely among agency workers, depending on their roles and experience. Managers must verify that each worker's certification matches the specific requirements of their role to ensure food safety.

## Do part-time staff need the same level of food hygiene certification as full-time?

Yes, part-time staff need exactly the same level of food hygiene certification as full-time staff. The certification level required depends on their role and responsibilities, not their working hours. For example, if they're handling food regularly, they'll need Level 2 certification regardless of whether they work 2 days or 5 days per week.

The key is matching the certification to the role - if they're handling high-risk foods, they need Level 2. If they're in support roles with minimal food contact like waiting staff, Level 1 is sufficient.

**Common misunderstanding: Part-time staff don't require the same rigorous food hygiene certification as full-time employees due to fewer working hours.**

The necessity for food hygiene certification is determined by the nature of the work, not the number of hours worked. Part-time employees handling food must have the same level of certification as full-time staff to ensure safety and compliance.

**Common misunderstanding: If part-time staff have limited food handling duties, they don't need food hygiene certification.**

Even staff with limited food handling roles must have the appropriate certification to prevent contamination and ensure safety. Certification ensures they understand the essential practices necessary for their specific duties, regardless of the extent of their food handling.
