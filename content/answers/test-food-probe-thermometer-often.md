Your probe thermometer needs to be tested using both hot and cold calibration methods regularly. You should test one or two different food probe thermometers every week which mean that every food probe thermometer gets tested every regularly.

Make sure to record both temperature readings in the pre-built probe thermometer accuracy test task in Pilla. This creates an important record of who tested it and when.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a food probe thermometer is calibrated, it doesn't need frequent testing.**

Even if a food probe thermometer is calibrated, frequent testing is essential to ensure ongoing accuracy. Factors like wear and tear, exposure to extreme temperatures, and environmental conditions can affect its performance over time. Regular testing, as advised, helps in maintaining precise readings crucial for food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Digital thermometers never lose accuracy, so they donâ€™t need regular testing.**

Digital thermometers, while advanced, are not immune to inaccuracies. Battery depletion, sensor degradation, and electronic malfunctions can lead to incorrect readings. Therefore, regular calibration checks are necessary to ensure they provide reliable measurements, especially in a food safety context.

## Do I need to test them even if they're working.

Yes absolutely, because it might seem like they are working just fine but without an accurate test you won't know for sure. That's why it's important to test them in hot and cold water regularly.

**Common misunderstanding: If a food probe thermometer displays a reading, it is always accurate.**

A functioning display does not guarantee accuracy. Thermometers can drift from their accurate state due to mechanical stress or prolonged use. Regular testing in both hot and cold conditions ensures that readings are within acceptable error margins, thus ensuring food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Visual inspection of the probe is enough to ensure its functionality.**

While a visual inspection can reveal obvious damage, it does not confirm the accuracy of the thermometer. Internal components may malfunction without visible signs, leading to inaccurate readings. Thus, systematic testing is necessary to verify its accuracy and reliability.
