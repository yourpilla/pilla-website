Yes, you should provide additional allergen training whenever your menu changes. This ensures all staff are up to date with the specific allergens in your new menu items. The training can be brief - even just 5 minutes - but it needs to be documented properly using the Training activity in Pilla.

Make sure to add all staff members involved to the 'Staff Visibility' section so they can see it as well, and upload any training materials or attendance records to the 'Content' box.

**Common misunderstanding: If a menu item is only temporarily changed, there's no need for allergen training.**

Even temporary menu changes require allergen training. Customers may have serious allergic reactions to even minor changes in ingredients. Ensuring staff are aware of these changes is critical to maintaining safety and customer trust.

**Common misunderstanding: Allergen training for new menu items is only necessary if the item contains one of the 14 major allergens.**

While the 14 major allergens are crucial, other allergens can also pose significant risks. Training should cover all potential allergens in new menu items to ensure comprehensive knowledge and safety.

Use the Training activity inside Pilla to record everything that happens with Training. Be sure to take written and photo documentation. Set a the Training activity to repeat so that you get notified when the training is due for renewal.

## Does this allergen update training need to be as detailed as our initial allergen awareness training?

No, this menu change training doesn't need to be as extensive as your initial allergen awareness training. While staff should already understand the 14 major allergens from their core training, these menu update sessions are specifically to familiarise them with your updated [allergen matrix](https://yourpilla.com/blog/14-major-allergens) for your new dishes.

If you're changing the way you are [managing allergens](https://yourpilla.com/blog/allergen-management), for example changing the way you inform customers about allergens, then you should also provide training for that too.

**Common misunderstanding: Brief allergen training sessions are unnecessary because staff already know the basics.**

Even though staff may know the basics, specific allergen details in new menu items can vary. Brief sessions are essential to update staff on these specifics, ensuring accurate communication with customers.

**Common misunderstanding: Once trained on allergen management, staff don't need refresher courses.**

Regular refreshers are vital, especially when there are changes to the menu or allergen management practices. This ongoing training helps reinforce important practices and adapt to any procedural changes.

## Do we need to document these quick allergen update sessions?

Yes, even these brief training sessions need to be documented. Use the Training activity in Pilla to record it - take a photo of the attendance register and upload it to the Content box. This creates an important record showing that your team is kept up to date with menu allergen information.

**Common misunderstanding: Documenting brief training sessions is an unnecessary bureaucratic step.**

Documentation of all training sessions, no matter how brief, is crucial for compliance and accountability. It provides a verifiable record that staff have been informed of new allergen information, which is vital in the event of a customer complaint or audit.

**Common misunderstanding: Only formal training sessions need official documentation.**

All training, including informal or brief update sessions, should be documented. This documentation supports transparency and shows diligence in maintaining staff awareness of allergen information.
