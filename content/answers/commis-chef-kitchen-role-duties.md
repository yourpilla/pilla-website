They also assist in basic cooking under supervision, learning the ropes of more complex culinary skills. This role is fundamental for anyone starting out in the culinary world, providing a solid foundation in kitchen operations.

**Common misunderstanding: A Commis Chef only does simple, unimportant tasks.**

Even though the tasks might seem simple, they are essential for the operation of the kitchen. These foundational tasks ensure that meals are prepared efficiently and correctly, supporting the overall team.

**Common misunderstanding: Commis Chefs don’t need any formal training.**

While on-the-job training is a significant part of being a Commis Chef, formal culinary training can also be beneficial and is often encouraged. This training helps them understand the basics of cooking and kitchen management, which are crucial for their development and efficiency in the kitchen.

## How does a Commis Chef progress in their career?

Commis Chefs can progress in their culinary careers by gaining experience and skills in various kitchen stations. As they learn and master different culinary techniques, they can move up to more responsible roles such as Chef de Partie or Sous Chef. Continuous learning, such as attending culinary workshops or taking advanced courses, also plays a significant role in their career progression. Also demonstrating a strong work ethic, creativity, and the ability to work under pressure are important for moving up the culinary ladder.

**Common misunderstanding: Career progression for Commis Chefs is limited.**

There are numerous opportunities for career advancement in the culinary field. With dedication and continuous improvement, Commis Chefs can ascend to top-level chef positions, overseeing entire kitchen operations.

**Common misunderstanding: Commis Chefs can only advance in large restaurants or hotels.**

Commis Chefs can progress in any culinary setting, including small eateries, large hotels, or private catering. The key is gaining diverse experiences and skills that contribute to their professional growth.

## What tasks are assigned to a junior chef?

Junior chefs, or Commis Chefs, are typically assigned tasks that support the daily operations of the kitchen. These include preparing ingredients for dishes, maintaining the cleanliness of the kitchen, and performing basic cooking tasks under the guidance of more experienced chefs. They may also be responsible for stocking kitchen supplies and ensuring that food items are stored properly. This role is designed to build their skills gradually, preparing them for more complex responsibilities.
