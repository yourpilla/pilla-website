# What if the food supplier sends different products than what we ordered?

When suppliers substitute products, it's crucial that they clearly indicate these changes in writing - verbal notifications are not acceptable. Any product substitutions must be mutually agreed upon and communicated via email or written documentation. This is particularly important for allergen management, as your allergen files and matrix may need to be updated.

If you receive products that don't match your order specifications, you should reject them and contact the supplier immediately. Make sure to clearly label any rejected items as "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area for disposal or return.

**Common misunderstanding: If a supplier substitutes a product with a similar item, it's not necessary to update allergen records since the items are alike.**

Even if a substituted product seems similar, it may contain different allergens or be produced in a facility with other allergen protocols. It is essential to update allergen records with every substitution to prevent potential health risks and ensure compliance with food safety regulations.

**Common misunderstanding: Verbal agreements about product substitutions are sufficient if there is a good relationship with the supplier.**

Relying on verbal agreements can lead to misunderstandings and lacks the accountability of written documentation. For legal and operational clarity, it's crucial to have all substitutions documented in writing to protect both parties and ensure smooth operations.

## What if we notice the wrong items after the delivery driver has left?

If you discover incorrect items after the delivery inspection, you should immediately label these items "not for consumption" and store them in a designated area away from other products. Contact your supplier right away to arrange returns or replacements.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the delivery driver leaves, it's too late to rectify any errors with the delivery.**

Even after the delivery driver has left, you still have the right and responsibility to address any discrepancies. Promptly documenting the error and contacting the supplier allows for resolution through returns or replacements, maintaining quality and safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Incorrect items don't need to be segregated if they won't be used.**

Incorrect items should always be segregated and labeled "not for consumption" to prevent accidental use and cross-contamination. This practice ensures food safety and operational integrity.

## Should we still check temperatures of incorrect items?

Yes, even if items are incorrect, you should still check and record their temperatures at delivery. For chilled foods, they should ideally be below 5°C (maximum 8°C), and frozen foods should be at -18°C (maximum -15°C). This information might be important when discussing the delivery issues with your supplier, and it's essential for maintaining your food safety records.

**Common misunderstanding: Temperature checks are unnecessary for incorrect deliveries since they won't be used.**

Conducting temperature checks on all deliveries, correct or incorrect, is vital for maintaining a comprehensive food safety record. This information is crucial when discussing issues with suppliers and can help identify trends that may indicate broader systemic issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording temperatures of incorrect items is only necessary if you plan to return them.**

Recording temperatures is essential regardless of your intention to return items. This practice supports food safety compliance and can provide valuable data during supplier negotiations or audits.
