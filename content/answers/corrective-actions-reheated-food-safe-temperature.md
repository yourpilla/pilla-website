If reheated food fails to reach the required safe temperature, it's important to take immediate corrective actions to prevent food-borne illness. Continue cooking the food until it reaches a minimum temperature of 75°C in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and 82°C in Scotland. If the equipment is faulty, use alternative equipment or divide the food into smaller portions to speed up the reheating process. Always ensure that the equipment is functioning properly, and if not, it may need to be repaired or replaced. Additionally, increase staff training and supervision to prevent future occurrences.

**Common misunderstanding: If food doesn't initially reach the safe temperature, it's okay to serve it after a short additional heating.**

Food must reach the safe minimum temperature throughout to ensure all harmful bacteria are killed. Short bursts of reheating without reaching the required temperature can still leave bacteria active, which can lead to food-borne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: All reheating equipment works the same for all types of food.**

Different foods may require different types of reheating equipment. Always use the appropriate equipment for the type of food you are reheating to ensure it reaches the required temperature efficiently and safely.

## How can food be reheated quickly and safely?

To reheat food quickly and safely, use equipment that is specifically designed for reheating and ensure it is pre-heated before use. This helps to quickly bring the food up to the required temperature without allowing bacteria to multiply. Divide larger portions of food into smaller ones to allow heat to distribute more evenly and quickly. Always check the internal temperature of the food with a food thermometer to ensure it has reached the safe minimum temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: Microwaving food is always a quick and safe method to reheat food.**

While microwaving is quick, it can sometimes heat food unevenly. Always stir food halfway through microwaving and check the temperature in several places with a food thermometer.

**Common misunderstanding: Higher temperatures in reheating equipment mean faster and safer reheating.**

While high temperatures can speed up reheating, they must be controlled to avoid burning the food while the interior might still be cold. Always ensure the food reaches the uniform required temperature.

## When should food be discarded instead of reheated again?

Food should be discarded instead of being reheated again if it has been reheated once already, as multiple reheating can increase the risk of food poisoning. Additionally, discard food if there is any sign of cross contamination or if it has not been stored properly between the initial cooking and reheating. Food that does not reach the safe temperature after an initial attempt to reheat should also be considered for discarding, especially if there is no way to safely bring it up to temperature.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s safe to reheat food multiple times as long as it reaches the safe temperature each time.**

Each cycle of reheating can increase the risk of food-borne illness, as it may pass through the danger zone of temperatures where bacteria can multiply.

**Common misunderstanding: Food that looks and smells fine can be reheated multiple times.**

Appearance and smell are not reliable indicators of food safety. Bacteria and toxins that cause food-borne illnesses may not affect the look or smell of food.
