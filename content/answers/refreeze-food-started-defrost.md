No, you should never refreeze food that has started to defrost. Once food begins to defrost, it must either be used immediately or discarded. If you have partially defrosted food, you should move it to a fridge and use it within 48 hours.

This is particularly important for items like ice cream which must be used immediately or discarded if they've started to defrost - these items cannot be refrozen under any circumstances.

**Common misunderstanding: Refreezing defrosted food is safe as long as it was refrigerated.**

Refreezing defrosted food, even if it was refrigerated, is not advisable because the quality and safety of the food may be compromised. Each freeze-thaw cycle allows bacteria to grow and can degrade the texture and flavour of the food.

**Common misunderstanding: You can refreeze food if it was thawed in a microwave.**

While a microwave can quickly thaw food, it can also rapidly bring portions of the food to temperatures where bacteria thrive. Therefore, refreezing food thawed in a microwave is not recommended unless it has been cooked immediately after thawing.

## What if the food still feels quite hard and has some ice on it?

If the food still feels completely hard and is still covered in ice, you can move it to another freezer unit. However, if there's any softening or the ice is melting, you'll need to treat it as defrosting food and either use it quickly or dispose of it.

**Common misunderstanding: Food with ice crystals is always safe to refreeze.**

The presence of ice crystals may indicate that the food is still partially frozen, but it doesn't guarantee safety for refreezing. If the food has begun to thaw at any point, especially in an uncontrolled environment, it should not be refrozen without cooking first.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as food is below freezing temperature, it can be moved between freezers without concern.**

While moving food between freezers can be safe, temperature fluctuations during the transfer could lead to partial thawing. It is crucial to minimize the time food spends outside of a controlled freezing environment to prevent bacterial growth.

## What should I do if I'm not sure how long the food has been defrosting?

If you're unsure about how long food has been defrosting, it's always better to err on the side of caution and discard it. This is especially important for raw meat and poultry - if there's any chance of cross-contamination, don't take the risk. The only exception would be if you can use the raw meat or poultry immediately in cooking.

**Common misunderstanding: If food looks and smells fine, it can be safely refrozen even if you're unsure of the defrosting duration.**

Visual and smell assessments cannot reliably determine food safety, especially for bacteria that do not affect appearance or odour. If the duration of defrosting is uncertain, it is safer to discard the food to avoid potential food-borne illnesses.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as you refreeze food within a few hours of defrosting, it remains safe.**

The safety of refreezing is not solely time-dependent but also relates to temperature exposure during defrosting. Even a few hours at room temperature can allow bacteria to proliferate, rendering the food unsafe to refreeze without cooking.
