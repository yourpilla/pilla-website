# How should cooked food temperatures be monitored and recorded?

To ensure food safety, it's important to monitor and record the temperatures of cooked foods. Recording the food item, its temperature, the date and time, and the person who recorded the data. Use a sanitised food thermometer to check the temperature and make sure it meets the safe cooking temperatures as specified (e.g., 75°C for at least 30 seconds).

**Common misunderstanding: Any thermometer can be used for recording food temperatures.**

Only use a sanitised food thermometer designed for cooking to ensure accurate and safe readings. Regular thermometers may not provide the precision needed for safe food handling.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording temperatures is only necessary for certain foods.**

All types of cooked foods should have their temperatures recorded to ensure they have been cooked to safe levels. This is crucial for preventing food-borne illnesses.

## How many temperature checks should be done each day?

You should create and complete five cooked food temperature tasks each day to record up to five examples of cooked foods. This helps in maintaining a consistent check on different food items and ensures that all cooked foods reach the necessary safe temperatures.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s okay to skip temperature checks if the food looks cooked.**

Visual checks are not reliable. Always use a thermometer to confirm that food has reached safe cooking temperatures.

**Common misunderstanding: Only one check per food item is enough.**

It's advisable to check the temperature in several places, especially in thicker cuts of meat, to ensure the entire item has reached the required temperature.

## What should I do if I don't cook anything all day?

If you don't end up cooking, you should select 'Nothing Cooked' in the Pilla Task. This helps maintain accurate records and ensures compliance with food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Leave the task incomplete if nothing cooked.**

Always complete the task by selecting 'Nothing Cooked'. This keeps your records complete and accurate.

**Common misunderstanding: Recording is only necessary when cooking multiple items.**

Even if only one item is cooked, it's important to record it. Every instance of cooking should be documented to maintain a thorough record of food safety practices.
