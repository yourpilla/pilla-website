  and operational pace.
---
When creating a job description for a barista, it's essential to reflect the specific needs and style of your venue. Start by listing the daily tasks that are truly relevant to your setup. Think about your service style, customer interaction, and the pace of your venue. This ensures the responsibilities align with your actual operational needs.

**Common misunderstanding: All barista job descriptions are the same, so one can simply use a template without modifications.**

Each coffee venue operates differently. Using a generic template without tailoring it to your specific needs can lead to hiring someone who may not fit well with your operational style or customer service expectations. Always customise the job description to reflect the unique aspects of your venue.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed job descriptions are unnecessary if you're hiring experienced baristas.**

Even experienced baristas need clear expectations to perform well in a new environment. Different venues have different priorities and styles, so detailed, venue-specific responsibilities help ensure new hires understand exactly what is expected of them.

## What’s the risk of using generic task lists for barista roles?

Using generic task lists can lead to mismatches between job expectations and actual duties, resulting in confusion and inefficiency. Generic lists might not cover specific tasks important for your venue, or they might include irrelevant duties that waste time and resources.

**Common misunderstanding: Generic task lists are sufficient because all barista jobs are similar.**

While barista roles share common elements, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the venue's pace, customer interaction style, and menu complexity. Tailoring the task list to your venue ensures that the barista's duties directly contribute to your operational goals.

**Common misunderstanding: It’s easier to adjust employee behavior on the job than to customize a task list beforehand.**

Adjusting employee behavior after hiring based on a generic task list can lead to frustration and decreased job satisfaction. It's more effective and efficient to set clear, specific expectations from the start to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Why is it important to categorise barista duties by time of shift?

Categorising duties by time of shift — such as opening, service, and closing — helps ensure that all necessary tasks are completed efficiently and at the right times. This organization aids in creating a smooth workflow and maintaining high standards of service throughout the day.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as all tasks are completed, the timing doesn’t matter.**

The timing of certain tasks is crucial for operational efficiency. For example, preparing the coffee station at the start of the day ensures that the barista is ready for the first customers, and proper closing procedures prevent morning delays and maintain equipment longevity.

**Common misunderstanding: Categorising tasks makes the job harder to learn.**

On the contrary, categorising tasks by time of shift can actually make training easier and more structured. New baristas can quickly learn what is expected of them at different times, which helps them manage their duties more effectively and reduces oversight.
