# What is the correct way to cook chicken livers safely?

To cook chicken livers safely, sauté them in batches for a minimum of 5 minutes or until their internal temperature is above 70°C for at least 2 minutes. This ensures that the livers are hot all the way through, effectively killing any harmful bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Cooking chicken livers for a short time at high heat makes them safe.**

Quick, high-heat cooking might leave the inside undercooked. It's important to maintain the right internal temperature for the correct duration to ensure safety.

**Common misunderstanding: If chicken livers look cooked on the outside, they are safe to eat.**

The outside might look ready, but harmful bacteria can survive inside if not cooked to the right temperature throughout. Always use a food thermometer to check.

## Why is colour alone not a reliable indicator when cooking livers?

Colour is not a reliable indicator of doneness in chicken livers because liver tissue can remain pink even when it has reached a safe temperature. The only way to ensure that livers are cooked safely is by checking that the internal temperature has reached at least 70°C for 2 minutes or more.

**Common misunderstanding: Pink chicken livers are undercooked.**

Chicken livers can remain pink even when fully cooked to the safe internal temperature. Always verify doneness with a thermometer.

**Common misunderstanding: All parts of the liver will change colour uniformly when cooked.**

Different parts of the liver might change colour at different rates. The internal temperature is the only accurate measure of doneness.

## What hygiene practices should be followed when handling chicken livers?

When handling chicken livers, it's important to prevent cross-contamination. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for chicken livers and other foods. Wash and sanitise all surfaces, utensils, and hands after handling raw livers. Ideally, utensils and cutting boards should be washed in hot soapy water and then sanitised in a dishwasher.

**Common misunderstanding: It's okay to use the same cutting board for chicken livers and other foods if washed quickly.**

Even quick washing might not remove all bacteria. Always use separate equipment for raw chicken livers to avoid cross-contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick rinse of utensils and hands is enough after handling chicken livers.**

Rinsing alone won't remove bacteria. Properly wash and sanitise all items and hands that come into contact with raw chicken livers to ensure safety.
