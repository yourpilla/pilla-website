When you're setting up a job description for a Barback, it's crucial to think about the specific tasks they'll be doing. Start by reviewing the daily responsibilities and then think about what skills are needed to perform these tasks well. For example, if the Barback needs to quickly restock items during busy periods, they'll need good organisational and time management skills.

**Common misunderstanding: All barbacks need the same skills, regardless of the bar.**

Each bar operates differently, so the skills needed can vary. A high-volume nightclub might need a Barback who is very fast and efficient, while a smaller, more relaxed bar may need someone who is good at interacting with customers as well as managing stock.

**Common misunderstanding: Skills are less important than experience.**

While experience is valuable, the specific skills a Barback brings can make or break their effectiveness. Focus on identifying skills that directly improve their ability to support your bar's operations.

## Why is it better to focus on real skills over generic traits?

Focusing on specific skills rather than generic traits helps you attract candidates who are better suited for the actual work they'll be doing. For instance, saying a Barback needs to be "hard-working" is less helpful than specifying they need "the ability to lift heavy weights" or "excellent time management skills" to keep up with a fast-paced environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Generic traits make it easier to find a good cultural fit.**

While cultural fit is important, it's the specific skills that will determine how well a Barback performs their job. You can always help someone to align with your culture through orientation and training, but they need to come with the right skills set.

**Common misunderstanding: Detailed skills make the job seem too demanding.**

Being clear about the skills needed actually helps set realistic expectations for the role. It ensures candidates know what they are applying for and can self-assess their suitability, which leads to more appropriate applications.

## How do I match tasks to necessary skill sets?

To match tasks to the necessary skills, first list out all the tasks that a Barback is expected to perform. Next, think about what it takes to perform each task effectively. For example, if a task involves setting up the bar before it opens, the necessary skills might include attention to detail, ability to follow instructions, and good organisational skills.

**Common misunderstanding: All tasks require the same level of skill.**

Different tasks can require different levels of skill or different types of skills. For instance, restocking might need physical strength and speed, while maintaining the cleanliness of the bar might require meticulousness and a good understanding of hygiene practices.

**Common misunderstanding: Itâ€™s enough to just list tasks in the job description.**

While listing tasks is important, linking them to specific skills helps potential candidates understand what is expected of them and assess their own suitability for the role. It also helps you evaluate candidates more effectively during the hiring process.
