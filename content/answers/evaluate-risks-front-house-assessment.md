  customers.
---
When evaluating risks in your restaurant's front of house, walk through the area during various service times to observe how staff and customers interact. This helps you spot potential hazards that could lead to accidents or injuries. Consider factors like floor conditions, equipment layout, and customer flow. It's crucial to assess both the likelihood of an incident occurring and the potential severity of the outcome if it does happen.

**Common misunderstanding: A risk assessment only needs to be done once.**

Risk assessments should be updated regularly, especially if there are changes in layout, staff, or service style. Continuous monitoring helps you keep on top of any new or evolving risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Only major risks need to be documented.**

You should document and act on all significant risks, It's up to you decide which risk are significant enough to mitigate. You don't need to mitigate every tiny risk but you do need to mitigate all significant risks even if they are not major.

## How do I determine if existing controls in the front of house are effective?

To determine if existing safety controls are effective, observe their implementation during peak service times. Ask staff about their experiences and any near-misses or difficulties they encounter. Reviewing past incident reports can also provide insights into whether current measures are preventing accidents. If issues are recurring, it may be time to consider stronger or additional controls.

**Common misunderstanding: If there haven't been any accidents, controls must be working.**

Lack of incidents doesn't necessarily mean controls are effective. It could also indicate that incidents are unreported or that luck has played a part. Continuous evaluation and staff feedback are essential.

**Common misunderstanding: All controls will work the same in any environment.**

Controls might need to be adjusted based on specific front of house layouts or the particular dynamics of your team and customer base. Customization can be key to effectiveness.

## What questions should I ask when deciding on new front of house safety measures?

When considering new safety measures, ask whether the measure will reduce the likelihood of a hazard occurring or the severity of an incident if it does happen. Consider if the solution is practical for staff to implement under pressure and during busy periods. Questions like "Can the hazard be removed completely?" or "Can the layout be improved to enhance safety?" are crucial in guiding your decisions.

**Common misunderstanding: More safety measures mean better safety.**

Adding too many controls can sometimes lead to confusion or non-compliance. Itâ€™s important to find a balance that enhances safety without overwhelming the team.

**Common misunderstanding: Once a new measure is implemented, no further action is needed.**

New safety measures should be monitored to assess their effectiveness. Adjustments may be necessary as you see how they perform in real service conditions.
