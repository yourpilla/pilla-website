  When writing a job description for a Commis Chef, clearly describe the
  kitchen's pace to help potential candidates understand the expected work
  environment.
---
When writing a job description for a Commis Chef, it's important to clearly describe the pace of your kitchen. This helps potential candidates understand what will be expected of them. For example, you might describe your kitchen as "fast-paced with a high volume of orders" or "a more deliberate pace focusing on intricate dish preparation." This clarity helps set the right expectations and attracts candidates who can thrive in your environment.

**Common misunderstanding: Any experienced chef can adapt to any kitchen pace.**

While experienced chefs are adaptable, they perform best in environments that match their skills and preferred working pace. Being specific about the kitchen's pace helps prevent mismatches and turnover.

**Common misunderstanding: Describing the pace of the kitchen isn't necessary if the cuisine type is mentioned.**

The type of cuisine does give some indication of the kitchen's pace, but it's not enough. A clear description of the pace helps candidates gauge the intensity and speed of work more accurately, regardless of the cuisine.

## Should I mention the pressure levels and how they align with the ideal candidate’s qualities?

Yes, it's very important to mention the pressure levels in your kitchen and describe the qualities of an ideal candidate that align with these conditions. For instance, if your kitchen is high-pressure, especially during peak times, you should look for candidates who are calm under pressure, quick to adapt, and efficient. Highlighting these required qualities ensures that you attract candidates who are not only skilled but also a good fit for the kitchen's dynamics.

**Common misunderstanding: Stress management skills are only needed in high-end or large kitchens.**

No matter the size or prestige of the kitchen, pressure levels can vary, and stress management is crucial in any busy kitchen environment. Clearly communicating this in the job description helps in selecting the right candidates.

**Common misunderstanding: If a chef is technically skilled, they can handle any kitchen environment.**

Technical skills are important, but the ability to handle stress and work under pressure is equally important. A chef who can't manage stress well might struggle in a high-pressure kitchen, affecting team dynamics and service quality.

## How do I illustrate what a typical service looks like regarding speed and complexity?

To give candidates a realistic picture of what they can expect, describe a typical service period in your job description. Mention how quickly dishes need to be prepared and the complexity of the tasks involved. For example, you might say, "During a typical service, the kitchen handles over 100 covers with dishes that require precise timing and complex plating techniques." This helps candidates visualize their potential workday and assess if they can meet the demands.

**Common misunderstanding: A busy service implies constant chaos and stress.**

While services can be busy, a well-organized kitchen with a good team can handle high volumes efficiently and calmly. Clarifying this can attract candidates who are efficient yet wary of chaotic environments.

**Common misunderstanding: Complexity in dishes is only about the cooking techniques used.**

Complexity can also involve the timing, coordination with other chefs, and presentation of the dishes. It's important to describe these aspects to attract candidates who are truly prepared for the role's demands.
