Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) are vital for ensuring public health, especially in the hospitality sector. They check if businesses comply with food safety laws, and help maintain high standards. Their work includes inspecting premises, advising businesses, and enforcing regulations if necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs only inspect food premises when there is a complaint.**

While responding to complaints is a part of their job, EHOs conduct regular, often unannounced, inspections to ensure ongoing compliance with food safety laws, not just when issues are reported.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs can arrest people during their inspections.**

EHOs do have significant powers, including issuing notices and closing businesses temporarily, but they do not have the power to arrest anyone.

## What businesses do EHOs inspect?

EHOs inspect a wide range of food-related businesses including restaurants, cafes, takeaways, hotels, hospitals, schools, care homes, nurseries, and food manufacturers. Essentially, any establishment that handles food could be subject to an inspection to ensure it meets health and safety standards.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs only focus on large restaurants and food chains.**

EHOs inspect all types of food businesses, big or small. This includes small independent businesses and even home-based food operations.

**Common misunderstanding: Non-food businesses are not inspected by EHOs.**

While their primary focus is on businesses that handle food, EHOs also inspect other types of premises for general health and safety compliance, especially if those businesses impact public health and safety.

## How is an EHO different to an Environmental Health Technician?

An Environmental Health Officer (EHO) typically has more training and qualifications compared to an Environmental Health Technician. EHOs can enforce more complex regulations and conduct in-depth inspections. Technicians may perform routine inspections and are involved in enforcing certain food safety laws, but they generally do not carry the same level of authority as EHOs.

**Common misunderstanding: Environmental Health Technicians can perform all the same duties as EHOs.**

While both roles contribute to maintaining public health standards, Technicians usually have fewer qualifications and less authority, particularly in complex legal or health matters.

**Common misunderstanding: Environmental Health Technicians are just assistants and donâ€™t inspect businesses.**

Technicians do inspect premises and have the authority to enforce certain regulations, but their scope is generally more limited compared to EHOs.
