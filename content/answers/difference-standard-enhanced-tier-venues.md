# What is the difference between Standard and Enhanced Tier venues under Martyn's Law?

Martyn's Law categorises venues into two tiers based on their capacity to enhance security measures against potential terrorist attacks. Standard Tier venues are those that expect between 200 and 799 people at one time, while Enhanced Tier venues are larger, expecting 800 or more people. The tier determines the level of security planning and measures required to comply with the law.

**Common misunderstanding: All venues, regardless of size, must meet the same security requirements under Martyn's Law.**

This is incorrect. The law applies different requirements based on venue capacity to ensure measures are proportionate to the potential risk and impact of an attack.

**Common misunderstanding: The distinction between tiers is based on the type of venue rather than its size.**

Actually, the tier classification is strictly based on the number of people the venue can hold, not the type of venue. Whether it's a restaurant, nightclub, or hotel, the capacity determines the tier.

## What obligations do Standard Tier (200–799 people) venues have?

Standard Tier venues must implement foundational security measures without necessarily investing in extensive physical infrastructure. Key obligations include registering the venue with the Security Industry Authority (SIA), developing a terrorism response plan, and ensuring staff are trained on these procedures. The focus is on planning, training, and procedural readiness rather than costly physical security enhancements.

**Common misunderstanding: Standard Tier venues need to install expensive security equipment like metal detectors.**

This is not required under Martyn's Law. The law emphasizes procedural and training measures for Standard Tier venues, not mandatory installation of security hardware.

**Common misunderstanding: Training isn't explicitly required for Standard Tier venues.**

While not separately listed, training is implied as essential. Venues must ensure their staff are familiar with and can execute the terrorism response plan effectively.

## What additional duties apply to Enhanced Tier (800+ people) venues?

Enhanced Tier venues, due to their larger size and capacity, face higher risks and therefore have additional security obligations. These include all the requirements of Standard Tier venues plus more proactive security measures such as enhanced surveillance, physical security enhancements, and possibly advanced screening processes. They must also document their security plans and submit these for regulatory review.

**Common misunderstanding: Enhanced Tier venues just need to focus on physical security upgrades.**

While physical security is more emphasized, Enhanced Tier venues also need to ensure robust procedural and staff training measures are in place.

**Common misunderstanding: Once the initial security plan is submitted, no further updates are necessary.**

Security plans must be regularly updated and resubmitted to reflect any changes in layout, capacity, or emerging threats, ensuring ongoing compliance and effectiveness.
