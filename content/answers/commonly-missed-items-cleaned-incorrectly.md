When cleaning a kitchen, it's easy to overlook smaller tools or hard-to-reach areas. Items like can openers, blender gaskets, and the undersides of cutting boards often don't get the attention they need. This can lead to food residue build-up, which is a breeding ground for bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: If it looks clean, it is clean.**

Just because an item looks clean doesn't mean it's free from bacteria or residue. Always clean thoroughly, paying special attention to nooks and crannies where food can get trapped.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick rinse is enough for small kitchen tools.**

Small kitchen tools need more than just a rinse. They should be fully washed with soap and hot water, and sometimes even disassembled to ensure all parts are cleaned properly.

## Which parts of chilling equipment are most likely to harbour bacteria?

The parts of chilling equipment that are most prone to harbouring bacteria are the seals, handles, and drip trays. These areas are often neglected during routine cleaning, allowing bacteria to grow and potentially contaminate food.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as the interior is cold, bacteria can’t survive.**

Cold temperatures slow down bacterial growth but don't eliminate it. Bacteria can still survive and multiply in colder environments, especially if there are food residues.

**Common misunderstanding: Chilling equipment doesn’t need regular deep cleaning.**

Regular deep cleaning is crucial for chilling equipment. Over time, even small amounts of food residue can lead to significant bacterial growth, affecting food safety.

## Why do dishwashers and slicers pose a high contamination risk?

Dishwashers and slicers pose a high contamination risk because they come into contact with food and can harbour bacteria in hard-to-reach places. For slicers, it’s the blades and food traps; for dishwashers, it’s the filters and jets.

**Common misunderstanding: Dishwashers sanitise everything inside thoroughly.**

While dishwashers are designed to clean, they might not reach all areas or remove all types of bacteria, especially if loaded improperly or not maintained. Regular checks and cleaning of filters and jets are necessary.

**Common misunderstanding: Slicers are safe as long as they look clean and are used frequently.**

Even frequent use can leave behind food particles that attract bacteria. It’s crucial to disassemble slicers for cleaning regularly to ensure all components are sanitized.

## What are examples of high-risk tools that often get overlooked?

High-risk tools that often get overlooked include rubber spatulas, ice scoops, and any utensils used in raw meat preparation. These tools can easily harbour bacteria if not cleaned and stored properly.

**Common misunderstanding: Rubber spatulas are safe if washed between uses.**

Washing between uses is important, but rubber spatulas can often have small cuts that harbour bacteria. They should be regularly inspected and replaced if damaged.

**Common misunderstanding: Ice scoops don’t need as much attention because they are used in ice.**

Despite being used in ice, scoops can transfer bacteria from hands or other surfaces to the ice, making them a contamination risk. They should be stored properly and cleaned regularly.
