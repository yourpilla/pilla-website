In a HACCP system, critical control points (CCPs) are the stages where control is applied to prevent or reduce a food safety hazard to an acceptable level. Identifying these points helps ensure that food is safe to eat. For example, cooking is a CCP because it's crucial to cook food to a certain temperature to kill harmful bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: Every step in the food production process is a critical control point.**

Not all steps in food production are CCPs. Only those that can prevent, eliminate, or reduce a hazard to an acceptable level are considered critical. Itâ€™s important to focus on these key areas to effectively manage food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: CCPs are the same in every food business.**

CCPs vary depending on the type of food being produced and the specific processes involved. Each business needs a tailored HACCP plan that identifies CCPs relevant to their operations.

## How are CCPs determined in a food production process?

CCPs are determined during the hazard analysis stage of developing a HACCP plan. The team identifies potential hazards and then analyses which steps in the process control these hazards. For instance, if bacterial contamination is a risk, the cooking step might be a CCP because proper cooking temperatures kill bacteria.

**Common misunderstanding: CCPs are based on personal judgment alone.**

Identifying CCPs is not just a matter of opinion. It involves a systematic analysis based on scientific data and regulatory standards to determine where hazards can be effectively controlled.

**Common misunderstanding: Once CCPs are set, they do not need to be reviewed.**

CCPs should be regularly reviewed and updated based on new information, changes in equipment, or changes in the production process to ensure they remain effective in controlling hazards.

## Why are CCPs essential for food safety management?

CCPs are essential because they target the specific steps in food production where hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels. Proper management of CCPs helps prevent foodborne illnesses and ensures compliance with food safety regulations. For example, ensuring that chicken is cooked to the right temperature can prevent salmonella poisoning.

**Common misunderstanding: CCPs only need to be monitored by the food safety manager.**

Monitoring CCPs is a team effort. While the food safety manager oversees the process, all staff involved in the production should understand and be trained to monitor and manage CCPs effectively.
