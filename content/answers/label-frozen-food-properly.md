When labelling frozen food, you need to include three key pieces of information: the date of production, a use-by date (one month from production), and clearly mark any allergens present in the food. Make sure food is properly portioned and thoroughly wrapped before freezing.

**Common misunderstanding: As long as frozen food is packaged securely, labelling isn't necessary.**

While secure packaging is crucial for preventing freezer burn and contamination, proper labelling is equally important for traceability and food safety. Labels provide essential information such as production and expiration dates, which help avoid food spoilage and ensure that allergens are clearly identified, protecting consumers with allergies.

**Common misunderstanding: Allergens don't need to be labeled on frozen food as freezing neutralises allergens.**

Freezing does not neutralise allergens. Allergens remain present and can still trigger reactions in sensitive individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to clearly label any allergens on frozen food packaging to ensure consumer safety.

## What happens if I forget to label something in the freezer?

If food items aren't properly labeled, a manager or responsible person will need to assess whether the food should be discarded. It's always better to err on the side of caution - if you're unsure about when something was frozen or what allergens it contains, it's safer to dispose of it.

**Common misunderstanding: It's safe to rely on the appearance and smell of frozen food to determine its safety if it's not labeled.**

Appearance and smell are not reliable indicators of frozen food safety. Freezing can preserve food's outward appearance and the development of spoilage odors may be inhibited. Without proper labelling, it's impossible to accurately assess the safety of the food, including its age and potential allergen content.

**Common misunderstanding: Once food is frozen, it doesn't matter how long it stays in the freezer as it's indefinitely safe.**

While freezing preserves food and halts bacterial growth, it does not stop food quality from degrading over time. Each type of food has a recommended freezing duration to maintain its best quality. Beyond this period, although the food may still be safe to eat, its taste and texture can deteriorate significantly.

## Should I label food differently if it's raw meat versus cooked food?

While the basic labelling requirements are the same, it's important to note that raw meat should ideally not be frozen if possible. However, if you must freeze raw meat, ensure it's adequately wrapped, properly date labeled, and used within one month. Make sure the meat is properly chilled (below 5°C) before freezing to ensure better quality preservation.
