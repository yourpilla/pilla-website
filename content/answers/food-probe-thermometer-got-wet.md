Use boiling water to ensure a reading of 100째C (with a 1 degree tolerance) for the hot test, and an ice bath to verify a reading of 0째C (also with a 1 degree tolerance) for the cold test. If the readings deviate from these ranges, cease using the probe and remove it from service."

# What do I do if my food probe thermometer gets wet?

Food probe thermometers should never be immersed in liquids as this can damage the internal components and cause inaccurate readings. If your probe does get wet, you should immediately dry it thoroughly and then test its accuracy using both the hot and cold testing methods.

For the hot test, use boiling water and ensure a reading of 100째C (with 1 degree tolerance). For the cold test, use an ice bath to check for a reading of 0째C (again with 1 degree tolerance). If the readings are outside these ranges, the probe should be taken out of service.

**Common misunderstanding: Immersing the entire food probe thermometer in water is an effective way to clean it thoroughly.**

This is a common misconception. Immersing the entire food probe thermometer in water can lead to water damage and affect its accuracy. Instead, only the probe tip should be cleaned with warm soapy water, followed by sanitizing with alcohol swabs. This approach prevents water from entering the internal components and ensures the longevity and accuracy of the thermometer.

**Common misunderstanding: Using a wet food probe thermometer will not impact its temperature readings significantly.**

In reality, using a wet food probe thermometer can lead to inaccurate readings. Moisture inside the thermometer can interfere with its electronic components, causing erroneous temperature measurements. Always ensure the thermometer is completely dry before use to maintain accurate and reliable readings.

## How can I prevent my probe from getting wet in the future?

To protect your probe, always handle it with care and only insert the metal probe tip into foods when testing temperatures. Store it in its protective case when not in use, and never leave it in environments with extreme temperatures like fridges or near hot surfaces. Regular cleaning should only involve washing the probe tip with warm soapy water, followed by sanitising with alcohol swabs.

**Common misunderstanding: Storing the probe thermometer in the refrigerator is a good practice to keep it ready for use.**

This is incorrect. Storing the probe thermometer in the refrigerator can expose it to moisture and condensation, potentially damaging its electronic components. Instead, always store your probe thermometer in a dry, room-temperature environment and use a protective case to further safeguard against moisture and physical damage.

**Common misunderstanding: Leaving the probe thermometer on a hot surface momentarily will not cause any damage.**

Leaving the probe thermometer on hot surfaces, even briefly, can cause damage to both the plastic casing and the internal electronics. Exposure to high temperatures can warp the materials and compromise the accuracy of the thermometer. Always ensure the probe is placed away from heat sources when not in use.

## What if my probe shows signs of internal moisture or fogging?

If you notice any internal fogging or moisture inside the display, this is a serious issue. The probe should be immediately taken out of service and reported to your head chef.

**Common misunderstanding: A little fogging inside the thermometer's display is normal and does not affect its performance.**

Contrary to this belief, any fogging or signs of moisture inside the thermometer's display indicate a malfunction. This condition can severely impair the accuracy of the readings, posing a risk to food safety. It is crucial to address any moisture issues immediately by taking the probe out of service and arranging for a replacement.

**Common misunderstanding: Internal moisture can be ignored if the thermometer still seems to function properly.**

Ignoring internal moisture can lead to significant inaccuracies over time, even if the thermometer appears to function correctly initially. Moisture can damage the sensitive electronic components, leading to unreliable temperature readings. It's essential to replace any thermometer showing signs of internal moisture to ensure food safety and compliance with health regulations.
