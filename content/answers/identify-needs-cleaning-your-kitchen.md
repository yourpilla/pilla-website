Identifying what needs cleaning in your kitchen starts with a thorough inspection. Look at all surfaces, equipment, and hard-to-reach areas. Check for any visible dirt, grease, or food particles. Remember, a clean kitchen is crucial for food safety and helps create a pleasant working environment.

**Common misunderstanding: If it looks clean, it doesn't need to be cleaned.**

Even if surfaces appear clean, they can still harbor bacteria and germs. Regular cleaning and sanitising are important, even for areas that look spotless.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning only the areas used daily is enough.**

It’s important to clean all areas regularly, including those that aren’t used as often. This prevents the build-up of grease and dirt that can lead to bigger cleaning tasks later.

## What should be included in a kitchen walkthrough for cleaning planning?

A kitchen walkthrough for cleaning planning should include checking all areas where food is prepared and stored. Look at cooking equipment, storage areas, sinks, and waste disposal areas. Make a list of tasks for each area, noting any special requirements for cleaning materials or techniques.

**Common misunderstanding: A quick walkthrough is enough to plan cleaning.**

A thorough walkthrough is necessary to ensure nothing is missed. This means opening appliances, moving equipment if safe to do so, and checking under sinks and shelves.

**Common misunderstanding: The same cleaning plan works for every kitchen.**

Each kitchen is unique, so your cleaning plan should be tailored to its specific needs and layout. What works for one kitchen might not be suitable for another.

## What are common hygiene blind spots to look for during inspections?

Common hygiene blind spots in kitchens include areas behind appliances, under sinks, and inside ovens. Also, don’t forget high surfaces like the tops of cabinets and light fixtures, which can collect dust and grease.

**Common misunderstanding: Out of sight, out of mind.**

Just because you can't easily see an area doesn't mean it stays clean. These hidden spots can be breeding grounds for bacteria if not regularly cleaned.

**Common misunderstanding: Once cleaned, these areas don’t need regular checks.**

Regular inspections and cleaning are necessary, even for areas that don’t get dirty quickly. Consistency is key to maintaining hygiene standards.

## Why is it important to speak with the cleaning team before writing the schedule?

Speaking with the cleaning team before writing the schedule helps ensure that the plan is realistic and considers their insights and challenges. They can provide valuable information on areas that need more attention and the best times for cleaning tasks, ensuring efficient and effective cleaning.

**Common misunderstanding: The cleaning team should just follow the schedule given to them.**

A schedule should be a collaborative effort. The cleaning team's experience and knowledge are crucial for creating an effective cleaning plan.

**Common misunderstanding: Cleaning schedules don’t need to be flexible.**

Flexibility in a cleaning schedule is important to accommodate unexpected situations or emergencies. Discussing with your team allows for adjustments that maintain high standards of cleanliness without disrupting kitchen operations.
