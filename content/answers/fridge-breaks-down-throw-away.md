If you're unsure how long the fridge has been broken down overnight, you should discard all the food and record it as waste. However, if you can verify the food temperature is still below 8째C using a probe thermometer, you can safely transfer it to another working fridge.

**Common misunderstanding: If a fridge breaks down, it's always safer to discard all food, regardless of the temperature.**

This is not entirely true. While food safety is paramount, if you can verify that the food temperature has remained below 8째C using a probe thermometer, the food can be safely transferred to a working fridge. This practice not only prevents unnecessary waste but also ensures compliance with food safety standards. Accurate temperature checks and proper documentation are crucial in these scenarios.

**Common misunderstanding: Fridge breakdowns are rare and not a significant concern in the hospitality industry.**

Fridge breakdowns are more common than many realise and can pose serious risks to food safety and operational efficiency. Regular maintenance checks and prompt response to any malfunctions are essential to prevent potential health hazards and reduce waste. Implementing a robust protocol for dealing with incidents is important for maintaining food safety standards.

## How do we properly document a fridge breakdown?

Find the next fridge temperature check task for the broken unit in Pilla and highlight it as an issue. Add detailed comments about what happened, including:

-   The temperatures you recorded
-   What food was discarded
-   What food was saved and moved
-   Which alternative fridge you moved food toMake sure to tag any colleagues who need to know about the situation.

**Common misunderstanding: Documenting fridge breakdowns is unnecessary if you inform your team verbally.**

Relying solely on verbal communication for documenting fridge breakdowns is inadequate. Documenting provides a structured and traceable method to record all pertinent details such as temperatures, discarded and moved food, and actions taken. This documentation is vital not only for internal tracking but also for compliance with health regulations and inspections. It ensures that all team members have access to consistent and accurate information.

**Common misunderstanding: Once documented in Pilla, there's no need to follow up on a fridge breakdown.**

Documenting the fridge breakdown in Pilla is just the first step. Follow-ups are necessary to ensure that the issue is resolved and to prevent recurrence. This includes scheduling maintenance checks, verifying that relocated food remains safe, and updating any impacted procedures. Continuous monitoring and follow-up actions are key to maintaining operational efficiency and food safety.
