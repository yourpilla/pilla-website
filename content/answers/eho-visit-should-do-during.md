# What should an EHO do during a visit?

During a visit, an Environmental Health Officer (EHO) should conduct a thorough inspection of your food business. They will check for compliance with food safety laws, focusing on areas like food handling, storage, and preparation. The EHO will also assess the cleanliness and structure of your premises, and the effectiveness of your food safety management system.

**Common misunderstanding: EHOs only check the kitchen and food storage areas.**

While kitchens and storage areas are crucial, EHOs also review other aspects such as staff training records, pest control measures, and waste management systems. Every part of your operation that affects food safety will be inspected.

**Common misunderstanding: EHO visits are just about finding faults.**

EHOs aim to ensure public safety and help businesses improve. They provide valuable feedback and guidance on how to maintain or enhance food safety standards, not just point out problems.

## What information should I receive after an EHO inspection?

After an inspection, you should receive a detailed report from the EHO. This report will outline any issues found and the necessary actions to address them. It will also include your food hygiene rating if applicable. The EHO should provide clear feedback and explanations in writing, detailing any breaches in food safety and the corrective measures required.

**Common misunderstanding: The report only contains negative findings.**

The report also highlights areas where your business meets or exceeds standards. It's a balanced view of your food safety practices.

**Common misunderstanding: No immediate feedback is given.**

EHOs typically provide verbal feedback during their visit, especially if urgent issues need addressing. This immediate feedback allows you to start making improvements right away.

## What rights do I have if I disagree with an EHO’s decision?

If you disagree with an EHO's decision or the outcome of an inspection, you have the right to appeal. The EHO should explain your rights of appeal during their visit and in their report. Typically, you must first discuss your concerns with the EHO or their office. If unresolved, you can formally appeal to their supervisory body or, in some cases, to a tribunal or court.

**Common misunderstanding: Appeals must be filed immediately.**

You usually have a specific timeframe within which to file an appeal, often detailed in the EHO's report. It’s important to act within these time limits.

**Common misunderstanding: You need a lawyer to appeal an EHO’s decision.**

While legal advice can be beneficial, especially for complex cases, it's not always necessary. You can often handle appeals through administrative processes provided by the local authority.
