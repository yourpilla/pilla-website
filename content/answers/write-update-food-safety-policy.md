Every business in the hospitality sector should have a written food safety policy from the start. This policy needs to be updated whenever there are significant changes in the business or in food safety legislation. It's crucial to keep this policy current to ensure compliance with laws and to maintain the safety of your food and customers.

**Common misunderstanding: A food safety policy only needs to be written once and never changed.**

Food safety regulations and business operations can change, making it important to update your policy regularly. This ensures that your practices are always compliant and effective in managing food safety risks.

**Common misunderstanding: Small businesses don’t need a formal food safety policy.**

All food-related businesses, regardless of size, must have a food safety policy. This is not only a legal requirement but also a fundamental practice to ensure the safety and well-being of both customers and staff.

## How often should a food safety policy be reviewed?

A food safety policy should be reviewed at least annually. However, it's wise to review and revise it more frequently if there are changes within your business, such as new food handling processes, or if new food safety regulations come into effect. Regular reviews help to ensure that the policy remains effective and compliant with current standards.

**Common misunderstanding: Reviewing a food safety policy every few years is enough.**

Food safety is a dynamic field, with frequent updates to regulations and best practices. Reviewing your policy only every few years might leave your business non-compliant with new laws, potentially leading to health risks and legal issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Only large changes in operations require a review of the food safety policy.**

Even small changes in your business operations can affect food safety. Regular reviews help to catch and address these changes promptly, maintaining a high standard of food safety.

## What triggers the need for a new or revised food safety policy?

Several triggers can necessitate a new or revised food safety policy. These include changes in food safety legislation, alterations in your business operations such as new menu items or cooking techniques, incidents like food safety breaches, and feedback from food safety inspections. It's important to stay proactive and responsive to these triggers to ensure ongoing compliance and safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Only negative incidents should trigger a review of the food safety policy.**

While incidents are clear triggers, proactive reviews and updates can prevent such issues. Regularly updating your policy as a preventive measure is just as important as reacting to incidents.

**Common misunderstanding: Changes in food safety laws don’t affect existing policies.**

New laws can require changes in how you manage food safety. Keeping abreast of legal changes and updating your policy accordingly is essential to remain compliant and ensure the safety of your operations.
