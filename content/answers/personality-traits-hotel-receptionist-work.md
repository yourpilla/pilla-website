---
For a hotel receptionist, the right personality traits are key to success. Traits like being calm under pressure, organised, and having a teamwork-centric attitude help in managing the busy environment of a hotel reception. These traits ensure that guests are welcomed warmly and efficiently, contributing to a positive guest experience.

**Common misunderstanding: Any friendly person can be a good receptionist.**

While friendliness is important, it's not enough on its own. A good receptionist also needs to be able to handle stress, multitask, and solve problems quickly, especially during busy periods or when dealing with challenging guests.

**Common misunderstanding: Experience is more important than personality.**

Experience is valuable, but the right personality traits can be more crucial for long-term success. Traits like reliability, attention to detail, and proactive communication are essential, regardless of previous experience.

## How do I avoid vague personality descriptions like “positive attitude”?

When writing job descriptions or interviewing candidates, it's important to be specific about the personality traits you're looking for. Instead of saying "positive attitude", describe what that looks like in action. For example, you might say "demonstrates enthusiasm for helping guests and can maintain a cheerful demeanour even during busy times".

**Common misunderstanding: Being specific about personality traits can limit your applicant pool.**

Being specific actually helps attract candidates who are a better fit for the role and more likely to succeed. It also reduces the time spent interviewing unsuitable candidates.

**Common misunderstanding: Generic traits like “hard-working” are enough to find the right candidate.**

While hard-working is a desirable trait, it’s too broad and doesn’t provide insight into how the candidate will handle specific situations at the hotel reception. Specify how their hard work will apply to the tasks and challenges of the job.

## What specific guest-facing behaviours should I look for in applicants?

Look for behaviours that demonstrate excellent customer service skills, such as the ability to remember and use guests' names, a genuine smile, and attentive listening. Other important behaviours include the ability to handle complaints gracefully and an eagerness to go above and beyond to solve guest issues.

**Common misunderstanding: Any experienced receptionist will have the right guest-facing behaviours.**

Experience doesn't always guarantee the right behaviours. Focus on how they describe their interactions with guests and ask for specific examples during interviews to see how they apply their skills.

**Common misunderstanding: Technical skills are more important than behavioural skills.**

While technical skills are necessary, guest-facing behaviours often have a greater impact on the overall guest experience. A receptionist who can make guests feel valued and cared for can significantly enhance your hotel's reputation and guest satisfaction.
