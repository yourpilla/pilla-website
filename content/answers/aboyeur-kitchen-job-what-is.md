# What is the job of an Aboyeur in a kitchen?

The job of an Aboyeur, also known as an Expediter, is important in a busy kitchen. They act as the communication link between the kitchen staff and the front of the house. This role involves coordinating orders, ensuring that food is prepared in the right sequence, and that dishes are correctly plated and sent out to customers promptly.

**Common misunderstanding: An Aboyeur is just another term for a waiter or waitress.**

While an Aboyeur does work closely with the service team, their role is more focused on managing the flow of dishes from the kitchen to the dining area, rather than serving tables directly. They ensure that the kitchen's output matches the orders exactly, and that modifications or special requests are communicated and implemented correctly.

**Common misunderstanding: The Aboyeur's job is only about shouting orders in the kitchen.**

While communication is a big part of their job, Aboyeurs also play a key role in quality control, making sure each dish meets the restaurant’s standards before it leaves the kitchen. They need a keen eye for detail and a good understanding of how each dish should be presented.

## How does an Expediter ensure smooth food service?

An Expediter, or Aboyeur, ensures smooth food service by managing the timing and order in which dishes are cooked and by communicating clearly with both kitchen staff and the front of the house. They oversee the order tickets, coordinate the timing of dish preparation, and check the presentation of dishes before they are served to ensure consistency and quality.

**Common misunderstanding: Expediters are responsible for the cooking process.**

Expediters do not cook; instead, they organise and direct the flow of dishes. They make sure that the chefs are aware of the order in which meals should be prepared and that these meals are ready at the right time.

**Common misunderstanding: An Expediter’s role isn’t necessary in a small restaurant.**

Even in smaller settings, an Expediter can play a role in maintaining order and efficiency, especially during peak times. They help prevent bottlenecks and ensure that every customer receives their meal cooked well and served promptly.

## What communication skills does an Aboyeur need?

An Aboyeur needs excellent verbal communication skills to relay information between the kitchen and the dining area effectively. They must be clear and concise to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that orders are executed correctly. Good listening skills and the ability to handle stress are also crucial, as they need to manage multiple tasks and respond to changes quickly.

**Common misunderstanding: Aboyeurs only need to communicate with the kitchen staff.**

While their primary interaction is with the kitchen, Aboyeurs also need to communicate effectively with the front-of-house staff to ensure that customer requests and feedback are accurately passed on and addressed.

**Common misunderstanding: Aboyeurs can rely solely on verbal skills.**

In addition to strong verbal communication, Aboyeurs also benefit from good non-verbal skills, such as body language and eye contact, which can help in managing the pace and stress of the kitchen environment effectively.
