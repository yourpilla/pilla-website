# Where should I store my food probe thermometer?

Your food probe thermometer should always be stored in its protective case when not in use. This protects it from physical damage, dust, and other contaminants that could affect its performance. Never store it in extreme temperature environments like fridges, freezers, on hobs, or in ovens as this can damage the probe's sensitivity and accuracy.

**Common misunderstanding: Storing a food probe thermometer in a refrigerator or freezer helps maintain its calibration.**

Storing a food probe thermometer in extreme temperatures, such as in a refrigerator or freezer, can actually harm its calibration. Extreme cold can cause damage to the probeâ€™s internal components, leading to inaccurate readings. Always store the thermometer in its protective case at room temperature to ensure its accuracy and longevity.

**Common misunderstanding: You can store a food probe thermometer anywhere as long as it's clean.**

While cleanliness is important, the storage environment is equally crucial. Storing your thermometer in areas exposed to moisture, heat, or direct sunlight can damage the probe and affect its performance. It is best to store it in a dry, stable environment away from temperature extremes to maintain its functionality.

## How do I make sure my probe stays clean in storage?

Before storing your probe, you should always clean and sanitise it properly. First wash it with warm soapy water, then rinse with clean water, and finally sanitise using alcohol swabs or bleach solution. This double cleaning process prevents cross-contamination and ensures accurate readings next time you use it.

**Common misunderstanding: Rinsing a food probe thermometer with water is sufficient for cleaning before storage.**

Simply rinsing a food probe thermometer with water is not sufficient to eliminate bacteria or contaminants. Proper cleaning requires washing with warm soapy water, followed by rinsing and sanitizing with alcohol swabs or a bleach solution. This ensures that the probe is free from harmful bacteria that could lead to cross-contamination.

**Common misunderstanding: Sanitising a food probe thermometer isn't necessary if it was only used on cooked foods.**

Even if a food probe thermometer is used solely for cooked foods, sanitising is crucial. Residual bacteria can still be present, and without proper cleaning, these can multiply or transfer to other foods. Adhering to a thorough cleaning and sanitisation process ensures food safety and accurate readings.

## Should I check my probe for damage before putting it away?

Yes, it's essential to inspect your probe before storage. Look for any signs of wear and tear like cracks, chips, or bends in the probe. Check that the display is clear and there's no internal fogging. Even slight damage can lead to unreliable temperature readings, so regular inspection is crucial for food safety. If you notice any damage, the probe should be taken out of service and replaced.

**Common misunderstanding: Minor cracks or chips on a food probe thermometer do not affect its performance.**

Even minor cracks or chips can significantly affect a food probe thermometer's accuracy. These damages can harbor bacteria and may cause erroneous temperature readings, compromising food safety. Inspecting your probe for any damage before storage is essential to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.

**Common misunderstanding: If the display works, the probe is fine for use.**

A functioning display does not guarantee the probe's accuracy. Internal damage or probe tip issues can still lead to inaccurate readings, despite a working display. Regularly inspect the probe for external and internal damage, such as fogging or bends, to ensure it provides reliable temperature measurements.
