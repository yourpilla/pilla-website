# How can I use a convection oven for cooling hot food?

Using a convection oven for cooling can be a quick way to bring down the temperature of food. Some convection ovens have a specific setting to remove heat and steam, allowing you to set a temperature as low as 30°C. This method can cool food rapidly within 5-10 minutes to this temperature, but remember to further cool the food to below 20°C quickly, ideally within 90 minutes total.

**Common misunderstanding: You can leave food in the convection oven until it reaches fridge temperature.**

While convection ovens can cool food quickly to around 30°C, they aren't designed to bring food down to refrigeration temperatures. You'll need to transfer the food to a cooler environment, like a walk-in fridge, to finish the cooling process safely.

**Common misunderstanding: Convection ovens can replace blast chillers for cooling.**

Although convection ovens can assist in the cooling process, they are not as effective or safe as blast chillers for rapid cooling. Use them only when blast chillers are not available, and always follow up with additional cooling methods.

## What is the function of a convection oven in removing heat and steam?

Convection ovens designed with a heat and steam removal function can be set to operate at lower temperatures, around 30°C. This feature is particularly useful for quickly reducing the temperature of hot foods by removing excess heat and steam from the oven chamber, thereby initiating the cooling process more efficiently than in a standard oven setting.

**Common misunderstanding: All convection ovens can remove heat and steam.**

Not all convection ovens have the capability to remove heat and steam. It's important to check your oven's specifications or manual to confirm if this function is available before relying on it for cooling purposes.

**Common misunderstanding: The heat and steam removal function can cool food to safe storage temperatures.**

This function is intended to start the cooling process by lowering the initial high temperatures of cooked food. However, it does not cool food to the safe storage temperatures required for refrigeration or freezing. Further cooling is necessary to reach these temperatures.

## When should I further cool food below 20°c after using a convection oven?

After using a convection oven to quickly reduce the temperature of food to around 30°C, it's crucial to continue cooling the food to below 20°C as quickly as possible. The entire cooling process, from cooked temperature to below 20°C, should not exceed 90 minutes to ensure food safety.

**Common misunderstanding: Food is safe once it reaches 30°C in a convection oven.**

Reaching 30°C is just an initial step in the cooling process. Food must be cooled further to below 20°C to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Always ensure that this additional cooling step is completed within the total 90-minute window.

**Common misunderstanding: You can cool food at room temperature after using a convection oven.**

Leaving food to cool at room temperature after initial cooling in a convection oven can be risky, as it might not reach the required temperature fast enough. Always use a controlled cooling method, such as a walk-in fridge, to quickly bring the temperature down to safe levels.
