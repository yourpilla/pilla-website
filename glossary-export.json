But in the restaurant industry and the retail industry, the front of house is the area where magic happens, where guests are welcomed, wined, dined, served, and bid farewell.</p><p>FOH stands for Front of House, a term that covers all customer-facing aspects of a restaurant and retail operation. From the waiting area to the dining room, bar and shop floor, these spaces form all of the guest’s experience. The FOH meaning extends beyond these physical spaces, encompassing all actions that a customer can witness during their visit, contrasting with the back of house (BOH), where behind-the-scenes tasks like food preparation and stock control take place.</p><p>The dining room is where restaurant guests spend most of their time, making it a vital area for FOH staff members to maintain cleanly and orderly with the help of a kitchen display system. The hostess station, which significantly influences first impressions, should be prominently visible and continuously manned.</p><p>Host stands, also known as menu stands, hold menus or reservation books and serve as podiums in the restaurant setting.</p><p>In the context of retail, the shop floor is the equivalent of the front of house in a restaurant. It’s the stage where customers engage with products and sales associates, and where first impressions are made. The retail shop floor is meticulously designed to optimise customer flow and product placement, ensuring that shoppers can easily find what they’re looking for and perhaps discover items they didn’t know they needed.</p><p>Visual merchandising plays a crucial role on the shop floor, with displays arranged to catch the eye and entice customers. Sales associates, akin to servers in a restaurant, are the face of the retail brand. They provide customer service, assist with finding products, manage fitting rooms, and handle transactions. In a retail setting, the cashier’s desk serves a similar purpose to a hostess station, often being the first and last point of contact for customers.</p><p>The shop floor’s ambiance, cleanliness, and layout are all part of the FOH experience in retail, contributing to customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business. Just as in dining, the success of a retail operation heavily relies on the effectiveness of its front of house, or in this case, the shop floor experience.</p><p>The front of house holds the key to creating a positive dining experience, which is vital to the success of a restaurant. The excellence of FOH operations, such as the service provided by wait staff, is integral to building customer loyalty. With the rise of online reviews, the reputation of a restaurant’s FOH can significantly impact its success, underlining the importance of high standards in service and customer interaction.</p><p>The front of house staff, occupying various house positions, is an example of a well-tuned team, each member playing a critical role, each with specific responsibilities that contribute to the smooth operation of the restaurant or retail outlet.</p><p>The front-of-house manager oversees FOH operations, supervises staff training, and ensures guests have a positive experience. As part of FOH management, the head waiter, or captain, manages the dining room staff and coordinates with the head chef and sous chef to ensure a seamless dining experience.</p><p>Hosts and Hostesses</p><p>Hosts and hostesses form the welcoming committee, often being the first point of contact for guests. They play a critical role in making a good first impression, which sets the tone for the customer’s experience. Hosts manage the flow by tracking reservations, walk-ins, and guest wait times.</p><p>In a restaurant, they also coordinate the seating chart to balance the server’s workload and communicate any specials or restaurant events to the guests upon seating to keep the operation running smoothly.</p><p>Servers</p><p>Servers have a variety of responsibilities in a restaurant which can include acting as the bridge between the kitchen staff and the dining room, accurately recording customers’ food and drink orders, managing multiple tables and courses, and even addressing any customer complaints to ensure a satisfactory dining experience.</p><p>Bussers</p><p>Bussers work diligently in behind-the-scenes areas. They clear tables after guests leave, wipe down the surfaces, and keep resetting tables for new guests, placing clean linens, cutlery, and glassware according to the restaurant’s standards.</p><p>They also assist servers by refilling water, bringing clean silverware or condiments to the table as needed, and taking care of dirty dishes. Food runners, including the food runner in this context, help the kitchen manager to maintain smooth service.</p><p>Bartenders</p><p>Bartenders hold the reins of the bar, mixing drinks, serving beer and wine, maintaining bar inventory, and monitoring levels of spirits, mixers, beer, wine, and other bar supplies.</p><p>Bartenders also engage with guests, offering recommendations, answering questions about the drink menu, and creating a welcoming atmosphere by greeting guests.</p><p>Retail Associate</p><p>Retail associates are akin to servers in the restaurant's front of house. They are the direct representatives of the retail brand, providing personalised customer service, guiding customers through the range of products, managing fitting room logistics, and conducting sales transactions.</p><p>Their role is crucial in creating a positive shopping experience, offering product knowledge, and ensuring the shop floor is inviting and organised. By assisting customers with a smile and expert advice, retail associates play an integral part in fostering customer loyalty and driving sales, making them a key component of the retail front of house team.</p><p>Cashier</p><p>Cashiers, being the last point of contact for customers, give them a unique opportunity to leave a lasting impression. They are responsible for handling transactions with efficiency and accuracy, ensuring a smooth checkout process.</p><p>Cashiers must be adept at managing cash registers, processing payments, and addressing any billing queries. Their role extends beyond mere transactions; they are ambassadors of customer service, often tasked with answering questions, providing information about loyalty programs, and handling returns or exchanges with a positive attitude that reflects the establishment's commitment to customer satisfaction.</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cuboh.com/blog/front-of-house-meaning\">Comprehensive guide explaining the roles, skills, and challenges of Front of House (FOH) staff in restaurants.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eposnow.com/ca/resources/front-of-house-positions/\">Detailed resource outlining the roles and responsibilities of front of house positions in hospitality.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.7shifts.com/blog/restaurant-lingo-defined/\">Explains the meaning of FOH and its significance in the dining space and bar areas visible to customers.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.torrens.edu.au/stories/blog/hospitality/the-difference-between-the-front-of-house-and-back-of-house\">Educational article from Torrens University Australia discussing the differences between front and back of house in hospitality.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/front-of-house-vs-back-of-house\">Insightful article from Indeed defining front and back of house roles and offering improvement strategies.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"Front of house meaning in hospitality, retail and leisure settings including job roles.","schema":"<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"DefinedTerm\",\n  \"name\": \"Front of House\",\n  \"description\": \"Front of House represents the customer-facing area in restaurants and retail environments where guests are welcomed, served, and engaged throughout their visit.\",\n  \"inDefinedTermSet\": \"https://yourpilla.com/glossary\",\n  \"url\": \"https://yourpilla.com/glossary/front-of-house\"\n}\n</script>","seo title":"What does FOH Mean?","term":"Front of House (FOH)","Slug":"front-of-house","unique id":"1722413228237x822675295818064500"},{"breadcrumb schema":"","description html":"<p>The secret sauce happens 'back of house' meaning the area that customers don't see. This article unpacks the back of house in hospitality business and retail settings, its roles, significance, and challenges, providing insight into the invisible force that propels restaurant and retail success.</p><p>The back of the house (BOH) is all the areas away from the customer's view. It is a bustling environment where food is transformed into dishes and stock is converted into products. It's where the back of house employees, from line cooks to the back of house staff manager, work diligently to get everything ready for customers. The BOH is indeed the lifeblood of the restaurant and retail business, a vital cog in the wheel.</p><p>Dive deeper into the BOH, and you'll discover a network of specialised areas, each contributing to the seamless operations. The kitchen is the heart of the restaurant BOH, where food is stored, prepared, cooked, and plated. Here, the kitchen manager plays a key role in overseeing operations, ensuring food safety, and managing inventory, while line cooks are crucial in preparing and serving food, and ensuring orders are executed correctly.</p><p>In the retail sector, the stock room plays a critical role in the overall success of a store. It is the central hub for inventory management, where products are received, organised, and stored until they are needed on the sales floor. A well-managed stock room ensures that products are readily available, which is essential to meet customer demand and maintain a streamlined shopping experience.</p><p>The BOH also houses the manager's office, a hub for critical administrative work, from scheduling to inventory management. And let's not forget the break areas, crucial spaces for staff to relax and recharge, away from the hustle and bustle of the dining room and the restaurant floor.</p><p>The BOH might be hidden from the customer's view, but its operations directly impact the dining experience in a restaurant. From the freshness of ingredients to the presentation of the dish, every aspect is governed by the workings of the BOH. Efficient management of the BOH operations is, therefore, critical to customer satisfaction and a restaurant's reputation.</p><p>With the right equipment and an emphasis on customer service, the BOH can truly make or break a restaurant, especially when it comes to managing their own tables. Efficient BOH operations are essential in creating a positive dining experience for guests, highlighting the significant impact of BOH on customer satisfaction and the overall reputation of the restaurant.</p><p>Food quality and safety are paramount in the restaurant business. The BOH is where these aspects come to life. All staff members are trained in food safety and sanitation, ensuring every dish served meets the highest standards. Their adherence to food hygiene and safety standards is essential to prevent food-borne illnesses and safeguard customer health.</p><p>Efficiency and workflow are the backbone of BOH operations. An efficient kitchen workflow includes an organised kitchen, clear staff roles, strategic layout, timely dish preparation, enhanced service speed and ensuring food is delivered in a timely manner. These elements are essential for achieving functionality and efficiency in a kitchen or dining room.</p><p>While we have focused on the restaurant industry, it's worth noting that the concept of BOH extends to retail as well. Retail BOH operations involve inventory management, stockroom organisation, and logistics management. Just like in a restaurant, efficient BOH operations in retail are crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and overall business success.</p><p>In retail, BOH staff are responsible for managing inventory, handling deliveries, organising the stockroom for easy access and working closely with front of house staff to ensure a smooth shopping experience for customers.</p><p>From the executive chef to the line cooks, each position within the BOH staff has specific responsibilities, forming a clear chain of command. Teamwork is very important, and these roles are often very busy with many jobs to be done at once.</p><p>At the helm of the kitchen is the executive chef. They oversee menu creation, food ordering, and inventory costs. It's the executive chef who gives the restaurant its culinary identity, developing menus and creating recipes that define the establishment's offerings. But the role goes beyond the creative. Ensuring food safety, managing food quality, and supervising kitchen staff are also key responsibilities under the executive chef's purview.</p><p>Next in command is the sous chef. They hold significant responsibility for kitchen operations and staff oversight, acting as the right hand to the executive chef. The sous chef's role is vast, spanning from supervising kitchen staff to scheduling work shifts and training new employees. However, a sous chef's role isn't confined to management alone. They assist the head chef in food preparation, menu development, menu knowledge, and recipe creation, thereby playing a crucial role in the restaurant's culinary journey.</p><p>The line cooks are the foot soldiers of the BOH, responsible for the actual cooking and assembly of dishes. Following recipes and instructions from the head chef, they transform raw ingredients into edible works of art. In this process, the line cook and food runners play a crucial role in ensuring that the prepared dishes are delivered to the customers efficiently, with the food runner being a key team member. Line cooks have a variety of responsibilities, including preparing and cooking a variety of menu items, working at specific stations and collaborating with dining room staff to ensure timely and accurate plating of meals.</p><p>Inventory specialists ensure that all necessary items, from ingredients to service wear, are adequately stocked. They possess strong organisational skills and a clear understanding of the business's budget and inventory requirements. Inventory specialists have several key responsibilities, including monitoring spending, managing inventory turnover, working on minimising losses within the establishment, handling the placement of orders for inventory and supplies, and maintaining communication with both staff and management regarding inventory levels.</p><p>The stockroom manager's responsibilities include overseeing inventory and managing the stockroom, ensuring all stock management procedures are adhered to, maintaining a safe working environment for both staff and customers, and planning the use of storage space to ensure the BOH operates smoothly.</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.restaurant365.com/blog/restaurant-back-of-house-guide/\">This guide provides an in-depth look at restaurant back of house operations, offering insights into modern BOH technology and management strategies.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.torrens.edu.au/stories/blog/hospitality/the-difference-between-the-front-of-house-and-back-of-house\">An educational resource from Torrens University that explains the roles and responsibilities of back of house teams in hospitality settings.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/5/front-of-house-vs-back-of-house.html\">This article discusses the differences between front and back of house operations, focusing on the essential roles and functions of BOH in restaurants.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/front-of-house-vs-back-of-house\">Indeed provides a comprehensive overview of back of house areas, detailing the various roles and operational aspects within hospitality.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cuboh.com/blog/back-of-house-meaning\">Cuboh's guide explores the meaning and roles of back of house staff, highlighting their contributions to restaurant efficiency and operations.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"Back of house meaning in hospitality, retail and leisure settings including job roles.","schema":"<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"DefinedTerm\",\n  \"name\": \"Back of House\",\n  \"description\": \"Back of House refers to the operational areas in hospitality and retail settings that customers do not see.

The industry rule of thumb is to keep prime cost below 60% of total revenue, but this can vary depending on the type of business.</p><p>Let’s say you’re the manager of a busy city centre restaurant. You notice your prime cost has gone from 55% to 65% over the past month. To investigate, you break it down. You find COGS is the same but labour costs have increased due to recent overtime payments. Now you can adjust staff schedules, cross-train employees for better efficiency or consider hiring part-time staff to cover peak hours. By doing this you can get your prime cost back to industry standards and improve your restaurant’s profitability.'</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.fourth.com/article/restaurant-prime-cost\">This guide from Fourth Enterprises provides a comprehensive overview of restaurant prime cost, detailing its components such as cost of goods sold and labor costs.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://getorderly.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prime-cost\">Orderly's guide offers a detailed explanation of prime cost, including a calculator to help restaurants manage and optimize their prime cost percentages.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/restaurant-prime-cost?srsltid=AfmBOorMkDvG1j0E4UzF9YOgT9uqaqr0ebn2xq1BKvhpB4TsRjRUsblg\">Toast provides insights into calculating and understanding prime costs, emphasizing its importance in restaurant financial management.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.overeasyoffice.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-restaurant-prime-cost\">Over Easy Office's ultimate guide covers everything from calculation methods to management strategies for maintaining an ideal prime cost ratio.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.touchbistro.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-restaurants-prime-costs/\">TouchBistro explains the components of prime cost, including labor and cost of goods sold, and offers practical advice for restaurant operators.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"Prime cost combines the total of your food, beverage, and labour costs.

They’re picky about their drinks, so you reach for your jigger. As you make each martini, you use the jigger to measure out 2.5 oz of gin and 0.5 oz of vermouth. The result? Perfect, identical martinis that keep your customers happy and coming back for more. Without your jigger, you might end up with inconsistent drinks that will disappoint your regulars and harm your bar’s reputation.'</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.barschool.net/blog/bar-tools-jigger#:~:text=A%20jigger%20is%20a%20type,in%20the%20bartending%20world%20too.\">Detailed explanation of what a jigger is and its uses in the bartending world, provided by the European Bartender School.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/jigger-vs-shot#:~:text=Teaches%20Cooking%20I-,What%20Is%20a%20Jigger%3F,the%20kits%20of%20professional%20mixologists.\">Compares jiggers and shot glasses, providing insights into their differences and uses in mixology, from MasterClass.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/cocktail-101-measuring-utensils-jiggers-cups#:~:text=Jiggers%20are%20the%20basic%20hourglass,%2C%20or%203%2F4%20ounces.\">Explains the standard measurements of jiggers and their role in cocktail preparation, featured on Serious Eats.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.diageobaracademy.com/en-zz/home/bartender-skills-and-techniques/jigger\">Guide on how to use a jigger effectively, including advanced techniques for bartenders, by Diageo Bar Academy.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://nimblebar.co/bar-jiggers/\">In-depth guide covering various styles and sizes of bar jiggers, including usage tips and purchasing advice, from Nimble Bar Co.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"A jigger is a bartending tool used to measure liquor, ensuring consistent and accurate pours in cocktails.

It saves unnecessary food costs and disposal costs and aligns with consumer expectations for sustainability. By managing food waste well, restaurants, hotels and cafes can be more efficient, reduce their carbon footprint and be seen as a responsible business.</p><p>Let’s take a fictional example. You’re the head chef at a busy beachside restaurant. At a staff meeting you notice a lot of seafood is being thrown away each week. You decide to implement a food waste reduction strategy. You start by training your kitchen staff to store seafood properly to extend its shelf life. You introduce a ‘catch of the day’ special to use up fish that’s near its use by date. You work with your servers to educate customers on portion sizes to reduce plate waste. After a month you’ve reduced your seafood waste by 30%, saved money and reduced your environmental impact. This is what can happen when you understand and address food waste in a hospitality business effectively.</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://sustainablehospitalityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Food-waste-factsheet.pdf\">This factsheet from the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance provides a detailed overview of food waste in hospitality, including stages of operations where waste occurs.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/food-waste#:~:text=Food%20waste%20is%20food%20intended,food%20supply%20and%20consumption%20chain.\">An authoritative resource from the Australian Government explaining the definition of food waste and its occurrence across the food supply chain.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620329061\">A systematic review from ScienceDirect analyzing food waste in the hospitality and food services sector, providing a comprehensive academic perspective.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://refed.org/downloads/Restaurant_Guide_Web.pdf\">ReFED's guide offers practical strategies for reducing food waste in restaurants, based on interviews with sustainability and operations teams.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.wrap.ngo/resources/measuring-and-reporting-food-waste-hospitality-and-food-service\">Guidelines from WRAP for measuring and reporting food waste in the hospitality sector, offering practical tools and resources.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"Food waste refers to any food discarded or uneaten in restaurants, cafes, bars, and hotels.

By receiving detailed feedback from a customer's perspective, hospitality businesses can fine-tune their operations, enhance guest satisfaction, and stay competitive in the market.</p><p>Let's say you're the manager of a popular city-centre restaurant. You've noticed a slight dip in customer reviews lately and want to understand why. You hire a mystery shopper to visit your restaurant during peak dinner hours. The shopper arrives, is seated by the host, orders a variety of dishes, and interacts with several staff members. They pay attention to everything from the cleanliness of the restrooms to the friendliness of the servers and the quality of the food. After their visit, they submit a detailed report. You discover that while the food quality remains excellent, there's a significant delay in service during busy periods. Armed with this information, you can now work on improving your staff scheduling and kitchen efficiency to address the issue and boost customer satisfaction.'</p><div class=\"external-reading\"><h2>External Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.intouchinsight.com/resources/guides/what-is-mystery-shopping/\">In-depth guide on mystery shopping in hospitality, covering evaluation from guest perspective.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/7-steps-to-implement-a-mystery-shopping-program-for-hotels/\">Step-by-step resource on implementing a mystery shopping program in hotels.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://serviceevaluation.com/the-essential-guide-to-mystery-shopping/\">Comprehensive guide explaining the process and purpose of mystery shopping.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.clickworker.com/customer-blog/mystery-shopping/\">Detailed explanation of mystery shopping as a method to test service quality.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://goaudits.com/blog/digital-hotel-mystery-audits-elevate-standards/\">Guide on conducting digital mystery audits in hotels to improve service standards.</a></li></ul></div>","meta ":"A mystery shopper visits hotels, restaurants, cafes, or bars anonymously to assess service quality, cleanliness, and staff behaviour, providing valuable feedback for improvement.","schema":"<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"DefinedTerm\",\n  \"name\": \"Mystery shopper\",\n  \"description\": \"A mystery shopper is a person hired to pose as a regular customer to evaluate service, cleanliness and overall experience at a hospitality establishment.
